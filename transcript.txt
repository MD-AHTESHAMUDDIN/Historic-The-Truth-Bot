[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] march 1933 a new chancellor of germany is 
elected he does not seize power with conspiracy  
he uses no violence he is made chancellor 
according to the laws of german democracy  
a democracy he has openly and truthfully promised 
to destroy he promises openly and truthfully  
to end the unfinished business of world war 
one with blood if need be he is adolf hitler
world war ii was unfinished business without 
knowledge of the great european war of 1914-1918  
we cannot comprehend the war that convulsed the 
world from 39 to 45 [Applause] even the fighting  
that tore across the remotest pacific islands 
and the densest asian jungle cannot be understood  
the leaders of the world in 1939 were men 
shaped by the first world war hitler had  
seen the war at first hand as an infantry man 
in the trenches of the western front and there  
were older men who had seen a generation of the 
young lost consumed by an industrial war machine
when these men took part in the post-war cult 
of the war dead laying wreaths at monuments  
across the continent they felt the presence of 
millions of souls standing behind them [Music]  
to understand how and why war returned to europe 
in 1939 is to understand how and why war came to  
europe in 1914 and how and why that conflict 
ended the cause of war in 1914 was the simple  
problem of germany of how the then new country 
of germany could be accepted as a great power by  
other much older powers france russia and britain 
in a tangle of alliances a climate of aggressive  
rivalry between these countries burst into war 
world war one ended in a strange anti-climax  
it's hard for us to remember that after a massive 
victory in the east ending in abject russian  
surrender and the conquest of vast lands germany 
itself collapsed to defeat without being invaded  
many germans believed that their armies had been 
stabbed in the back betrayed not defeated at all  
the fighting stopped suddenly in 1918 with the 
armistice armistice is a word that means truce  
a temporary halt to fighting the first world 
war was supposedly ended by the versailles  
conference and treaty a summit of france britain 
italy and america met to decide on a system of  
security that would guarantee peace in europe 
lenin's new revolutionary government in the  
soviet union was not invited germany was 
summoned only to sign the resulting treaty  
the french demanded that the treaty formally 
blame germany for starting the war britain saw  
the war more as a terrible mistake every line of 
the treaty followed from the supposed german guilt  
the guarantee of peace was to be the 
punishment and weakening of germany  
in fact each line was a recipe for a future 
renewed war germany lost territory in the east  
where huge areas had been won from soviet russia 
these gains of what in later years would be called  
lebanese realm living space were taken 
away and used to create a new nation poland  
a high-minded and noble idea was that states 
should be decided by nationality therefore  
the polish had a country of their own rather 
than living as minorities in germany or russia
the fighting had devastated huge areas 
of northern france and nearly bankrupted  
the economies of both britain and france the 
versailles settlement insisted that germany  
pay reparations huge sums were to be paid 
to pay off the debts of france and britain  
repaying money loaned by america the sums were 
unimaginably large crippling the german economy  
versailles imposed military humiliation upon 
germany insisting the rhineland that area of  
germany adjacent to france be demilitarized the 
german army the largest in europe was to be cut  
to 100 000 not enough to defend germany let alone 
start a war the army was to have no modern weapons  
tanks or aircraft that had revolutionized world 
war one the german navy was to have no u-boats  
versailles established the league of 
nations which would provide a forum   in which international security could 
be policed and aggression contained  
as the people of europe mourned the lost 
generation they lived in a continent where the  
tensions that had torn the nations apart remained 
and upon which had been layered new resentments  
and new grievances now the most powerful country 
in europe remained with its strength size industry  
economy and population intact and with a whole 
catalog of further grievances and the success  
of versailles as a system for peace and 
security depended on german cooperation  
if germany refused to pay if she rearmed if 
she moved troops into the rhineland the only  
option open to france and britain was to 
restart the ghastly horror of the western  
front to renew the war fought to end all 
wars versailles was weakened from the start
the british thought the settlement unfair and 
unrealistic the french that the punishment of  
germany had not gone far enough that the 
only punishment of german breach was war  
total war made international relations a high 
risk game made for a bold individual gambler
what of the united states the power whose entry 
into the war in 1917 had weighed the scales  
against germany the usa turned in upon 
itself concerning itself with the 1920s  
and all that decade means for american 
history having entered into world affairs  
the united states turned its back on europe 
the congress refusing to ratify the treaty  
refusing to join the league the oceanic distances 
separating the old from the new world seemed  
to provide insurance from the problems of 
europe the map of europe was now a map to war  
the history determined and awaiting the minds 
and the wills to act out the script [Music]  
already as hitler took power in 1933 the system 
of reparations had collapsed amidst the world  
economic crisis for 13 years reparations 
had been a major issue keeping the war  
alive germany had lurched from financial disaster 
to disaster any individual germans money troubles  
the great inflation and the huge unemployment of 
the 1920s were laid at the feet of britain and  
france the germans felt robbed the french swindled 
but the germans were trying not to pay the british  
saw reparations as part of the problem feeling 
their abandonment would bring about a european  
economic recovery a run on banks in the early 
1930s had caused the payments to be written off  
and had discredited the german 
government helping bring hitler to power  
the 13 years of fighting over money helped destroy 
the versailles settlement britain came to regard  
everything the french said about germany as bad 
sense the french to feel disillusioned [Music]  
the story of the interwar years is complicated 
and it's just too easy to see a plot by hitler  
some system would work hitler was a 
dreamer of great schemes but whether  
events followed his plan is debatable 
plans and systems are imposed by history  
on events which are random on the actions of 
individuals that are spontaneous and improvised  
plans may exist dreams may be dropped but 
the gap between idea and reality is large
hitler presented the german people with one big 
idea the destruction of what he called the slave  
treaty of versailles and to once more make 
germany a power hitler's policy from taking  
power in 1933 was a succession of acts 
each a line-by-line deletion of versailles
one of the great paradoxes of hitler one of the 
many ways in which other political leaders and  
the ordinary voter in all countries misread hitler 
and nazism was in believing that hitler was like  
every other politician capable of saying anything 
out of office but doing something very different  
when in real power hitler was a politician of 
action and did just what he said he would do  
he promised to abandon democracy he 
claimed it the enemy of strong leadership  
and at the first opportunity proceeded to 
set about that very destruction [Music]
one month after hitler took office the german 
parliament the reichstag burnt to the ground it  
was arson the attack upon the center of german 
democracy is shrouded in conspiracy theory  
the controversy is central to the history of nazi 
germany the nazis blamed communists and claimed  
the arson was the prelude to a communist coup 
a plot to establish a soviet germany indeed in  
the polarized and extreme politics of germany at 
that time that was the goal of the nazis bolshevik  
enemies [Music] the alleged arsonist was marinus 
van der lu a young dutch communist arrested in the  
building that night his voice is silent as he was 
tried condemned and executed history will forever  
turn over and question the events of that night 
in berlin was vanderlube the patsy of the nazis  
who started the fire themselves to create a crisis 
they would then exploit was van der lubbe the tool  
of a real communist plot was there no plot but an 
imagined plot that a paranoid hitler thought real  
was van der lub the lone gunman responsible for 
the whole attack himself history can only show  
with certainty the result of the fire the physical 
and the political destruction of german democracy
the nazis used the emergency to suspend 
parliamentary democracy and arrest and imprison  
all communist and socialist opponents the office 
of chancellor was combined with that of president  
head of government became head of state the 
army swore personal loyalty to adolf hitler  
and a parliamentary democracy 
became a dictatorship [Music]  
vague and fanciful ideas of jewish responsibility 
for the war which seemed eccentric when the nazis  
were an opposition party were turned into real 
action according to hitler the jews sought the  
destruction of the aryan nordic german peoples 
and it caused war between britain and germany  
hitler believed the jews were using slav people 
via soviet communism to threaten the german race  
the result was persecution of 
jewish people and businesses   both formal and informal that spread 
to all parts of german society
[Music] hitler did as he promised he said he would end 
unemployment and did so implementing policy that  
was a german new deal a recovery program 
that was every bit as successful as that  
of roosevelt in the usa money was pumped into 
the economy through vast public works directly  
and indirectly creating jobs raising the level 
of demand and productivity throughout germany  
a lasting image of the 1930s is of hitler 
and other nazis proudly opening autobahns  
futurist highways of a new age it was a 
more ruthless new deal than roosevelt's  
the destruction of trades unions making the 
manipulation of the economy easier than in america
the great parades of nazism stupefying to the eye 
were the genuine expression of a nation willingly  
gladly and gratefully marching symbolically 
and actually in step with the will of one man
[Music]   in march 1935 germany reclaimed the tsar 
land yet another chapter of versailles and  
the post-war settlement unraveled the tsar was a 
small but economically important area of germany  
adjacent to the french border and was seized 
by france at the end of world war one [Music]  
the versailles treaty promised that 
after 15 years of french occupation   the population of the tsar could vote to 
choose french rule german rule or independence  
it was now two years into hitler's regime annie 
sarlander knew that union with germany meant  
joining an aggressive militaristic dictatorship 
that it would be a democratic vote to end  
democracy the people of the tsar were as 
educated as intelligent as any european people  
the issues at stake were fully and openly debated 
the french made a strong and attractive case for  
retention of their rule the voting was 
free and fair internationally monitored  
98 chose germany chose nazism chose hitler
each and every european of those times played 
a greater or lesser part in the coming of war
if the leading player on the stage of europe 
was hitler the supporting character was italian  
dictator benito mussolini mussolini and italy's 
story may be just as well explained as a desire  
for greatness the italian fascists came to power 
many years before the german nazis for reasons  
much the same although on the victorious side in 
world war one italy had felt cheated of the dew  
and just spoils in the piece mussolini created 
fascism as a dynamic politics of the future and  
had abolished democracy nazism had borrowed many 
basic political and visual ideas from fascism the  
central difference between the two leaders was the 
relationship each had between actions and words  
mussolini boasted and bragged talked of 
power but in reality italy was a weak country  
without the inherent strength the wealth resources 
and the industry to back up proud words mussolini  
felt himself the creator of fascism and senior 
to hitler [Music] in later years mussolini  
confronted with hitler's successes was impelled to 
somehow put his boasts into action these policies  
of vanity and envy would desperately weaken 
the strategy of the italian german alliance  
in 1935 italy invaded the 
african country of abyssinia   modern day ethiopia and the 
only african state until then  
independent a feudal monarchy ruled by a god king 
haile selassie the two countries had fought in  
the 19th century when italy had been defeated by 
an african army mussolini wanted revenge [Music]  
abyssinia had plans of imperial expansion of 
its own conflicting with italian interests  
spreading from somalia why did mussolini send his 
forces into battle when he did it was not as if  
the dictator needed a war to distract the italian 
population from internal italian affairs mussolini  
was secure in power and enjoyed the approval 
of the italian people it was not a war that  
italy could particularly afford and abyssinia 
was not a colony worth having for its wealth  
it was not that abyssinia was the 
target of a rival imperial power  
the world recognized that the remote 
african kingdom was in italy sphere   of interest there is probably no simpler 
answer than the vanity of benito mussolini
thus did one man's ego 
determine the fate of a nation  
how is the invasion of abyssinia a far 
away country of which europeans knew little  
a step on the path to war the answer is in the 
damage the abyssinian affair wrought upon the  
league of nations abyssinia was a member of the 
league selassie made a dignified appeal for help
the league debated action and imposed limited 
economic sanctions but stopped short of the one  
sanction which even in the 1930s was the most 
damaging the cutting of oil supplies to italy  
before any further action could be taken the 
league was presented with the fate accompli of an  
italian victory mussolini proclaimed the 
italian king the new emperor of abyssinia
hitler watched these events at a distance germany 
although not a member of the league scrupulously  
observed the sanctions against the italians 
hitler watched the inability to act to agree  
action against aggression and decided on his next 
move the re-occupation of the rhineland [Music]  
the treaty of versailles forbade germany from 
placing troops opposite the french border on  
march 7th 1936 hitler ordered his army to cross 
the rhine it was a gamble had france decided to go  
to war germany had not yet built up its strength 
to have any chance of resisting invasion it was  
a gamble hitler won [Music] france would not 
start a war alone the british public would not  
countenance military action the british did not 
think in terms of giving in to hitler rather that  
the germans were simply justified retaking full 
control of their own territory the reoccupation of  
the rhineland has been described as the real end 
of world war one and its aftermath after this time  
germany ceased to right the wrongs of versailles 
and moved to aggressive expansion [Music]  
if hitler paid little interest in the usa   across another ocean the empire of japan 
viewed america with envy and aggression
the place of japan and china in 
the build-up to the outbreak of war   is often neglected on the other side of the world 
great movements of people and ideas were unfolding  
acts perpetrated involving astounding 
cruelty and inhumanity huge conspiracies  
and war plans were forming in japan in 1926 a 
new emperor ascended the chrysanthemum throne  
hirohito as was and remains the custom a name 
was chosen for the era of the new monarch's reign  
this was to be the showa 
the era of illustrious peace  
the coming years were to bring anything but peace 
to the peoples of japan and asia in the interwar  
years japan's miraculous transformation 
into a modern society seemed to be failing
there was economic depression high 
unemployment and rural poverty   japan had sided with the victorious powers 
in world war one yet gained little from the  
peace the abandonment of democracy by european 
states such as italy and germany seemed to hint  
to some japanese that they too should abandon the 
foreign ideas and return to a traditional society  
from the crowded japanese islands islands 
that lacked the resources needed to power  
a modern industrial society seemed a way out 
of the problems of recession and unemployment  
japan-eye china covetously resenting european 
powers exploiting the wealth of the region
japan came to be allied with the fascist powers 
but was not a fascist country economic need and  
greed were integrated with a traditional 
mythology to create a unique world view  
japanese society at all levels between the wars 
became permeated with an ideology of japanese  
racial superiority the god emperor giving the 
japanese race a distinction over other peoples  
who had lost their link with the divine this 
ideology saw a future war in which enlightened  
japanese liberated the less fortunate of asia and 
a war of world domination that would be fought  
against the united states as a developed 
industrial country japan shared in the  
industrialized nation's exploitation of 
china various treaties had allowed these  
countries concessions of territory inside 
china with the right to station troops  
the british territory of hong kong was the 
model from this presence japan planned to expand  
in 1931 japan had faked an attack by chinese 
troops upon japanese forces in manchuria  
in retaliation the army of japan invaded and 
conquered the chinese province renaming it  
manchu kyo and installing a puppet government 
headed by the last emperor of china puyi
with this vindication of their 
aggressive expansionist policy   the military gained more power becoming 
the dominant force of japanese policy
the invasion of manchuria is a major 
landmark on the timeline to war  
it was the first blow in the death of a thousand 
cuts that was inflicted upon the league of nations  
a whole year after the japanese completed their 
conquest the league issued a report carefully and  
worthily written that condemned japan's action 
nothing happened japan left the lead [Music]
this was a whole year before 
hitler's rise to power   in november 1936 fearful of russian communist 
ambition in the far east japan formed a pact  
with germany and italy the anti-common term pact 
directed against communist expansion this was not  
a relationship of great trust or shared ideology 
more of expedience and fear of a common enemy  
japan knew that nazism's white supremacism 
could never be reconciled with their own  
racial supremacy [Music] in 1937 full war broke 
out between china and japan the reason again a  
faked attack by china upon japanese troops the 
chinese led by the aggressive chiang kai-shek  
back the war was to be long and vicious from the 
very start in december 1937 the chinese capital  
of nanking fell as many as perhaps as one-third of 
a million chinese were killed in an orgy of murder  
rape torture and looting in 1937 one 
half of the world war had already begun  
chinese historians believe this 
was the start of world war ii
the french were to devote incredible sums of 
money in the second half of the 1930s to the  
construction of the maginot line named after 
the french war minister who conceived the plan  
the line was a complex of futuristic 
fortifications the line ran from  
switzerland to the luxembourg and belgium 
border and was designed to deter german attack  
the great weakness of the line was that it did not 
extend across all france's western border it was  
thought in politic to extend the forts against 
the belgians a friendly and neutral country
nearly half a million french troops 
inhabited underground cities of war   manning huge ammunition stores deep armored 
bunkers with underground roads and railways  
the rigidity of the maginot 
line reflected the french   strategic mind people who gaze into the future 
too often only see their past and france could  
not imagine a future war which did not begin 
with a german attack in the west upon france
while building its wall in the west 
france made defensive alliances   in the east but with what states did 
france make these defensive alliances  
czechoslovakia and poland small countries 
weak countries countries that it scores with  
whom hitler had grievance countries that had 
german minorities had german territory poland  
was notoriously unstable and aggressive 
with delusions of great power and status  
these alliances would be more likely to 
drag france into a war as deter germany
some historians see the german annexation of 
austria in 1938 as the start of the countdown to  
world war ii all previous events being the undoing 
of the punishments laid upon germany at versailles  
the union of austria and germany the angelus   went beyond any restitution 
and was aggressively expensive
nazism believed all german people 
should be members of the same state   and hitler himself had been born austrian 
the angelus would increase germany's base  
of population and industrial strength making 
further expansion possible it would be the  
first move in pushing germany's frontier to the 
east which hitler believed germany's destiny
the austrian nazis were in constant 
fermented agitation against the austrian  
government there was a history of violence and 
assassination of threatened and attempted coups
in 1936 austrian chancellor snake had made 
what was ironically called a gentleman's  
agreement with hitler concessions were 
made to the nazis yet the agitation  
continued two years later in february 
1938 hitler and snake met again and it  
was agreed that a nazi sympathizer be made 
minister in charge of austrian security
the austrian government saw this as part of a 
gradual taking over of austria and proposed a  
vote on angelus with the reoccupation of the 
rhineland hitler had bluffed his strength  
now german troops began to really 
mass on the austrian border
it is 1938 and the pace of history is accelerating  
the continent of europe spirals towards war with 
an ever-increasing ratcheting tension all over the  
continent and all over the world the pace of 
change the flow of events accelerated [Music]
japan began on a path to militaristic rule 
based on a belief in japanese racial supremacy  
the second world war really beginning 
perhaps in 1937 with japan's brutal  
furious and avaricious attack upon china war��
returned to europe in spain as the civil war  
tore the nation limb from limb the fires of war 
fueled by the extremes of fascism and communism  
with the democracies standing in impotent 
neutrality the second fascist power in europe  
italy embarked on a war of conquest annihilating 
the independent african country of abyssinia  
the lesson to the world was that violence was 
the means to the end and would be unopposed  
hitler unpicked versailles rearming the german 
nation turning with hungry and aggressive eyes  
to his weaker neighbors germany was united with 
austria a move that made germany even stronger
[Music]   the democracies were torn america retreated 
behind the oceans in isolation france in cynical  
defeatism built the maginot line as a shield 
against aggression but feared to renew the war  
britain had no desire for war and saw justice in 
hitler's demands the democracies aimed to resolve  
the problem of germany without resort to war to 
use diplomacy negotiation and fair compromise  
the word history has come to use of these times 
is appeasement it is the autumn of 1938 and hitler  
has turned his gaze to czechoslovakia a conference 
of nations is called in germany at munich  
after the angelus all of europe knew that 
something else was going to happen and knew  
that czechoslovakia was going to be that something 
else in october 1938 the leaders of the great  
powers of europe gathered at munich in germany for 
what was perhaps the first modern summit meeting  
but this was no stately diplomatic conference 
held in a palace the leaders flew to a conference  
held before the newsreel cameras of the 
world under the gaze of the public eye  
the leaders speaking sound bites for the media 
they met to resolve the problem of czechoslovakia  
czechoslovakia was a democratic state a 
state ally to the french czechoslovakia  
was a thorn in the side of hitler's 
state physically thrusting into the right  
politically challenging both the ideas and beliefs 
of nazism czechoslovakia was an isolated state  
with germany between her and her french ally 
and surrounded by states that were unfriendly  
if the conference failed if hitler and the nazis 
chose to act against czechoslovakia there could  
be no half measures on the part of britain and 
france no sanctions that would help no supply of  
arms to protect czechoslovakia from nazi 
aggression would need full general war in europe
the nation whose future lay on the table at munich 
had a modern army but was not a fundamentally  
strong state politically czechoslovakia was not 
a state of checks the modern democratic society  
contained minorities of slovaks and hungarians 
and above all germans the sudeten germans  
a three million strong minority living in the 
areas adjacent to germany the austrian angelus  
set these people of fire with excitement they were 
aflame ungovernable stirred by a call of history  
destiny and blood the citizens of austria 
abandoned democracy for nationalism the  
germans of czechoslovakia went the same way 
hitler did not foment the nationalism in the  
sudeten germans he simply tapped into passion 
and desire that already existed of course hitler  
sought to liberate his fellow germans but 
he also wished to eliminate the czech nation  
as an ally of the french and add czechoslovakia's 
modern industrial economy to germany  
as the leaders gathered both sides had differing 
goals both hitler and czech president banish  
wanted matters brought to a head hitler and 
banesh did not want to compromise the czechs  
knew that any concession to the german minority 
would bring demands from their other minorities  
hitler wanted total success the french and the 
british wanted a compromise they did not want  
to risk war or humiliation in negotiation the 
british led by chairman actually thought the  
sudeten germans were a minority whose rights were 
ignored by the czechs the french had an alliance  
with czechoslovakia an alliance the french made 
for french benefit to threaten germany with war  
on two fronts now they realized they were impotent 
to aid their ally and desperately needed to avoid  
the humiliation of breaking their promises 
to the czechs chamberlain reluctantly said  
if germany did decide to destroy czechoslovakia 
i do not see how this can be prevented  
the objective of britain and france at munich was 
not to restrain germany not to counter hitler's  
ambition it was to make the czechs give ground 
to make concessions that would prevent a general  
european war the czechs aggressively opposed 
concession at one point in the spring of 1938  
they had mobilized their entire army and placed 
it against the german border terrifying britain  
and france [Music] all throughout the summer of 
1938 the great powers of europe had circled round  
each other guessing each other's intentions 
banash thought that by definedly raising  
the stakes he could make britain and france 
threatened more and so make hitler back down  
hitler knowing britain and france's reluctance 
to go to war insisted on having his way rejecting  
compromise after compromise angrily accusing the 
czechs of attempting to ethnically cleanse the  
sudetenland and insisted that the 
sudeten people would only be safe  
as part of germany chamberlain was certain of 
hitler's good faith when the german promised that  
he had no further demands of czechoslovakia 
than the liberation of the sudeten germans  
the issue came to head with the international 
summit meeting held at munich on september  
29th hitler made no demands at this meeting 
he waited for the proposals to be offered  
the anglo-french offer to hitler was everything 
he asked the sudetenland to be incorporated  
chamberlain firmly believed that the incorporation 
of the sudeten germans was the right thing to do  
and believed hitler when he said that he had no 
desire to rule the czechs the czechs were told  
that if they did not accept they the czechs would 
be responsible for the war and could expect no  
help the czechs signed and the sudetenland 
became part of the german right [Music]
the czech state was destroyed unviable hitler 
summoned president hatcher banish's successor and  
instructed him to sign away the independence of 
bohemia the rump of czech lands which on march 15  
1939 became a german protectorate 
britain's government did not see  
the german occupation of prague as a break in 
the new order supposedly established at munich  
as german troops brought nazi rule to the czechs 
the british government held that the events  
simply proved that the czech state was unviable 
fractured by nationalities and that europe was  
made a safer place by its absence where the events 
really shifted where history took a new path  
was in a groundswell of public opinion perhaps in 
reaction to the joy of munich british attitudes  
in the streets the views of ordinary people 
changed hitler would never be trusted again  
the british media turned against 
appeasement and called for hitler to be opposed in the steps to war in these last months 
of peace the soviet union so distant and removed  
from much of european affairs throughout 
the decade became increasingly involved  
if hitler was the prime mover of war the 
originator of the events that impaled the   continent of conflict it was stalin that 
opened the door for hitler to walk to war  
with the conflict over the polish corridor 
in density hitler's aggression and ambition  
finally began to impinge on stalin and 
the soviet union britain and france  
saw the soviet union as the key to deterring war 
against hitler british prime minister chamberlain  
and french premier delegate knew that if hitler 
chose to fight in poland their alliances with  
poland would be of little practical help poland 
was as isolated as had been czechoslovakia  
they could not move forces into polish 
territory they could only threaten war   from the west hitler might once more play a game 
of dare with britain and france challenging them  
to start general european war in order to save a 
far away country whom they could not directly help  
britain and france know that the soviet union 
could directly help poland and so war be averted  
but poland saw the russians as bad if not 
worse than hitler they rejected any move that  
would bring soviet troops into their territory the 
poles thought that the red army once inside poland  
would never leave and there was no inducement 
no incentive that britain and france could offer  
too often histories use the language of the 
gambler in describing the actions of leaders  
in hitler's case nothing could be truer with 
the benefit of history it is hard for us to  
remember that the leaders of all the powers in 
1939 had little idea of what each other thought  
to tell what we today call spin propaganda from 
what was truth all through the summer of 1939  
hitler was involved in negotiations with stalin 
the negotiations were about nothing were going  
nowhere neither hitler or stalin would say what 
they wanted both mistrusted each other both knew  
they represented political systems which were 
incompatible and could not coexist in peace then  
hitler gambled he revealed his ambition to attack 
the poles and offered stalin half of poland stalin  
picked up the offer stalin was obsessed with 
territory and saw the extension of his border  
westward as a resolution of old scores and 
in his paranoia an insurance against invasion  
a non-aggression pact was signed between german 
foreign minister ribentrop and his soviet equal  
molotov on august 22nd this news shocked the world 
and at a stroke all strategies of the british  
and the french were in ruins no one knew of the 
secret clauses built into the fact that in the  
event of war between poland and germany the ussr 
would attack in the east and take the eastern half  
of the polish nation poland was falsely confident 
it knew nothing of the secret agreement poland  
thought that britain and france would attack 
in the west causing hitler to split his forces  
in fact when war broke out the french did nothing   and sat behind the maginot line making small 
attacks slowly mobilizing calling up strength
the british were organizing the 
movement of their army across the sea
hitler gambled the french would not act 
in time and stripped the west of troops to  
bring overwhelming strength against the poles he 
planned a campaign so fast the french and british  
would be forced to watch helplessly as poland 
was destroyed poland's army was outnumbered  
outflanked and obsolete in equipment the 
polish cavalry still used horses there were  
virtually no tanks mostly obsolete aircraft 
had to counter a state-of-the-art luftwaffe

by october 6 all polish forces had surrendered   cynically the russians waited until it 
seemed certain that germany would triumph  
and finally moved on september 17th the german 
victory was stunning in less than one month  
at a loss of less than 14 000 dead the poles were 
defeated britain and france were shown as impotent
[Music]   in the tangle of events spreading 
out from hitler's decision to attack  
was a single page letter from albert 
einstein to franklin roosevelt einstein  
the most eminent scientist of his day 
german and jewish a refugee from nazism  
was the only scientist who could write directly 
to the president and be taken seriously
einstein warned roosevelt of germany's 
plans to investigate the military uses  
of uranium of the newly discovered atomic energy 
he warned that in taking over czechoslovakia  
germany had secured a rich uranium mine this 
single letter was to bear fruit five years later  
over the japanese cities of 
hiroshima and nagasaki [Music]  
with the british and french declaration of war the 
fighting spread across the world both countries  
were the center of worldwide empires britain was 
to call upon soldiers from australia new zealand  
canada and south africa the dominions 
self-governing members of britain's family  
these countries willingly and unhesitatingly 
declared war in germany at the same time  
as great britain from the colonies of the 
empire britain was to summon indian african  
and caribbean soldiers french forces contained 
soldiers from africa and indochina presciently  
some of france's toughest fighters were from 
vietnam the first week of the war did in fact  
see a french offensive in the west remarkable 
in the fact that its effect was so limited  
small numbers of french soldiers pushed eight 
kilometers inside germany to within sight of the  
siegfried line a line of german fortifications the 
match of the maginot line and there they stopped  
the professional predictors and theorists 
men who look into the future and attempt   to foretell the future wars often fail to see 
accurately misreading the lessons of the past in  
the summer and late autumn of 1939 much of europe 
lived in a state of febrile panic fearing attack  
from the air with bomb and poison gas futuristic 
theories of war predicted mass aerial assaults on  
the city centers it was commonly held that no 
defense was possible against attack by bombers
as the poles succumbed to defeat an occupation 
hitler offered britain and france peace he  
claimed to have no quarrel with france and desired 
active friendship with britain he called the war  
in the west a senseless waste of life and proposed 
a conference of the great powers that would  
create a new system of peace and security he was 
rejected we are so used to the story of world war  
a globally consuming conflict that spread across 
the world that the fact is lost that in 1939 the  
war was comparably small and could be reasonably 
assumed to be soluble in europe in october 1939  
britain and france were at war as were britain 
and france's overseas colonies germany was at war  
poland an occupied defeated country sliced 
up and lost the balkans were at peace  
some were pro-german like romania and hungary 
some were pro-british like yugoslavia and greece  
italy germany's ally remained neutral 
spain a supposed fascist power was neutral  
belgium and the netherlands were neutral all of 
scandinavia was neutral yet were key suppliers of  
raw materials to the nazis soviet russia trusted 
implicitly in the new relationship with nazi  
germany and believed itself safe from attack and 
was neutral america was neutral [Music] for the  
people of europe the long wait is over the tension 
the fear the anxiety of a decade has lifted
the pace of history had accelerated in the 
last year taking the continent on a roller  
coaster ride of emotions in 1938 britain 
had feared war issued gas masks and called  
up reserves as hitler took the continent to 
the brink of conflict over his demands the  
czechoslovakia's german minority the sudeten 
germans be incorporated into a greater germany
the democracies of britain and france met with 
the dictatorships of munich in perhaps the first  
modern summit meeting the result is a settlement 
dictated to the czechs that gives hitler all he  
desires the people of europe rejoice at the 
news believing a new order has come to pass  
one that promises a lasting peace with a 
commitment by the great powers to negotiation  
not war the continent believes hitler has no 
further demands the sudetenland joins the right
the illusion of success crashes to ruins within 
months the remainder of czechoslovakia is torn  
apart divided by avaricious neighbors orchestrated 
by germany the nazis now target their ambitions  
upon the state of poland demanding the return of 
german territory given to the polls after world  
war one these demands conceal a dark strategy of 
endless german eastwards expansion the product of  
an insatiable hunger for land to be taken from 
slavic peoples thought inhuman by nazi ideology  
there can be no compromise no appeasement 
unlike the czechs the poles refuse to bow  
to hitler's demands britain joins 
france in making an alliance with poland  
the final connection of the path 
to war is made by joseph stalin  
the soviet leader makes an alliance with 
hitler the deal gives hitler a free hand to  
destroy poland the communists are rewarded with 
half of poland pushing their borders westward
in just weeks the polish state is torn apart 
destroyed either subsumed into the german reich  
as german territory or subjected to the darkness 
of occupation by either nazi or soviet troops  
the allies stand helpless as the country 
they promise to aid is overwhelmed  
modern armored and mechanized armies sweeping 
aside the cavalry and foot soldiers of poland  
then nothing after weeks of furious 
fighting calm descends on the continent
the time that followed the 
destruction of poland in just   five weeks of frenetic activity came to 
be called the phony war france and britain  
demonstrated their decision to end appeasement 
and honored their decisions to aid poland but  
the democracies did little to actually help poland 
in any material way they did little that could  
indirectly help the polls by distracting 
or diverting hitler's attention [Music]  
france's commander-in-chief gamala saw the war 
only in terms of defending france repulsing a  
german attack this mentality spread down 
throughout the french army no attempt was  
made by france's heavy artillery to shell german 
industrial towns which were well within range
[Music]   small probing attacks were made into germany 
when the french reached the siegfried line  
fortifications which were the german 
equivalent of france's maginot line they   stopped the inactivity the passive waiting sapped 
the moral strength and the will of the french army  
demoralizing the many thousands of reservists 
summoned away from their civilian lives
in the coming war the u-boat and the aircraft 
carrier would become the dominant weapons   of naval warfare but the first encounters 
of the war at sea involved surface action  
germany had built a fleet of 
large ships surface raiders   designed to make long cruises into the 
oceans sinking and destroying merchant trade
one such ship was the admiral graf spey   she had sunk allied shipping in the indian 
ocean and off the coast of south america  
had fought a battle with british forces 
which she had powerfully outgunned   engine problems forced the grafts bay to take 
refuge in the neutral uruguayan port of montevideo  
in classic subterfuge the ships of the royal navy 
used false signals to convince the germans that  
a massive british fleet was assembling over the 
horizon the germans chose to scuttle the grass bay  
the encounter was presented to the 
british people as a great victory
[Music]
[Music]
the graf spey had taken many british prisoners and 
transferred these to her supply ship the altmark  
altmark was cornered off the coast of norway 
and took refuge in neutral norwegian waters  
a team of british marines 
daringly stormed the altmark   the british themselves violating norwegian 
neutrality and rescued the prisoners
[Music]   britain had learned some of the lessons of world 
war one and immediately introduced convoys against  
u-boat attack resources restricting the 
extent to which escorts could be provided  
churchill as britain's first lord of the 
admiralty in charge of britain's navy   shelled the wild maverick side of his 
nature insisting that defense measures  
were not enough and demanded search and destroy 
patrols be launched against submarines [Music]  
this was against all advice that this was 
proven to be a poor way to deal with u-boats  
churchill rejected the advice 
of the admirals the result was   that the british aircraft carrier the 
courageous was sunk and another badly damaged
war was being fought on land in 
europe in the forests of finland  
the global conflict that became world war ii   was in many ways a number of small wars that 
broke out at the same time and aggregated together
one such conflict was that fought 
between finland and the soviet union  
the fighting that broke out at the end of 
november 1939 was the direct outcome of the  
nazi soviet pact in which stalin demanded finland 
become part of russia's sphere of influence
the fighting was a result of finland's 
rejection of stalin's demands that their   shared frontier be moved further into finland and 
that finnish islands be given to the soviet union  
the russians feared invasion and wanted to push 
their borders further west as they had done in  
poland stalin was prepared to offer compromise 
but the finns saw the ussr as an implacable enemy  
and believed that concession would 
only bring further soviet demands
russian forces attacked across 
the whole length of the border   the soviet union mounted a full invasion of 
finland the russian soldiers were told that  
finnish workers would rise to welcome 
them as liberators from capitalism
the finnish army was small and poorly 
equipped in nearly every aspect however  
its troops had been intensively trained 
to operate in their native forest terrain   to operate in the dense woods of 
summer and the depths of winter snows
what's more the finnish soldiers were motivated 
by a fierce and determined patriotism the russians  
outnumbered the finns by more than 150 percent 
their imagined easy advance ended in stalemate  
the finns absorbed and repulsed repeated 
attacks and the russian superiority in  
air forces was negated by the short 
arctic winter day and poor weather  
the russian tanks were negated by a simple 
improvised weapon the molotov cocktail a bottle  
filled with gasoline and tar which was thrown into 
tank engines setting them on fire the communist  
tactics were naive separating their tanks from 
their infantry the russian armor was hunted down  
amongst the forests by finnish infantry on skis 
the russians attempted to swamp the fins by weight  
of numbers using crude human wave mass attacks 
the result was massacre by machine gun fire  
throughout the finnish war and the early stages 
of the eventual conflict with nazi germany  
soviet forces would be severely weakened by the 
butchery of soviet high command in stalin's purges  
the communist dictator destroyed the leadership 
of his army through a paranoid fear of plots and  
planned coup d'etat incredibly the russian 
forces had no white winter camouflage or  
winter survival skills and simply froze to death 
through the absence of winter clothing [Music]
finland appealed to the league of nations in 
its last major intervention in world affairs   the league proved as impotent 
as ever to prevent the war  
the ussr was expelled from the league and 
all member states urged to support the finns  
with germany supporting the soviet union such 
help the world could give finland had to pass  
through norway so tortuous was this route 
the finns had to fight alone and unaided
as 1939 passed into 1940 the finns turned 
to the counter-attack and won a series of  
stunning victories against the soviets whole 
divisions of communist infantry surrendered  
and vast numbers of heavy weapons were 
captured and turned on the russians
the finnish successes brought the russians to the 
negotiating table they also made the finns believe  
that ultimate victory was possible and led them 
to push for a hard bargain with the soviet union  
these tactical successes were a distracting 
illusion from the true strategic position  
that finland would in the long run be crushed 
by the sheer weight of her larger neighbor  
finland was falsely encouraged by a 
british and french plan to aid finland   in reality this was a plan to seize neighboring 
neutral sweden's iron ore deposits the finns  
judged that it was not a serious offer that 
britain and friends would really carry through
in the time being as the negotiations 
persisted the soviet army reorganized  
and mounted new heavier attacks the finnish 
army could take no more and in the end crumbled  
early in march 1940 the finn signed an 
armistice with the soviets in moscow  
the ussr could have pushed on to total 
victory and occupied the whole of finland   installing a puppet communist 
government yet they did not  
they accepted territory more than they originally 
demanded but still leaving finland's democratic  
institutions and the bulk of her territory intact 
it may be that the soviet union wished to avoid  
war with britain and france and wished for 
freedom to negotiate in the new europe [Music]  
in fighting finland the soviet union lost 
more than 200 000 men to the finn's 25  
000 the red army lost credibility and its 
final success was ignored by the world
the war drove finland a democratic nation 
a natural ally of britain and france into  
the arms of hitler as soon as the peace 
between russia and finland was concluded  
secret approaches were made by the nazis who saw 
finland to be an ally in the coming final conflict  
a war of destiny to destroy soviet communism 
germany supplied finland with new modern equipment  
and the finns rebuilt a modern army 
and planned for revenge against russia
on march 7th 1940 the queen elizabeth then the 
largest passenger liner in the world completed its  
maiden voyage docking in new york the liner had 
dashed across the atlantic at top speed the voyage  
was kept a total secret the ship had traveled 
alone without escort relying on her high top speed  
to outrun any possible attack by germany's u-boats 
she was sent to new york to complete fitting out  
and escape attack by air raids the enormous 
size of the lighter and her high speed made  
her as potent a weapon of war as any battleship 
delivering the resources of war in vast quantities  
in the coming years she and her sister 
liner the queen mary would make any   number of high-speed journeys across the 
ocean always alone always in top secret
in april 1940 the phony war disappeared and broke 
into real action germany mounted an invasion of  
the neutral scandinavian country of norway hitler 
saw norway as a weak northern flank the remote  
port of narvik in the far north of norway was 
the outlet for swedish iron ore essential for the  
german war effort during the finnish russian war 
france and britain had planned to seize the port  
and deny it to german shipping on the pretext that 
they were aiding the finnish fight against russia  
this scheme was abandoned after the finnish 
collapse against the soviets [Music]  
germany's war effort was largely economically 
self-sufficient and did not depend on  
international trade for those resources 
which germany did not possess rubber and oil  
advanced technology had found exact substitutes 
which could be created from coal one of the  
few materials which germany needed to 
import for its armament industry was ore   with which to produce the highest grade steels 
these had to be obtained from scandinavia  
actually from the neutral country of sweden 
but via the equally neutral norway [Music]
britain's war of resources was 
dependent on free atlantic sea trade   shipping came under intense attack and 
the battle of the atlantic between the  
two navies was to become a 
crucial conflict of the war
for germany's navy the key 
problem was access to the open sea   germany's coastline was short and easily 
closed off by the opposing british  
the german navy had already put to 
sea before the war had broken out   now as the conflict extended the key resource 
for the german navy was to gain further coastline  
from which to base u-boats and surface raiders the 
coast of norway with its fjords and deep inlets  
provided a series of harbors and bases to the 
germans that would enable them to threaten   merchant shipping and evade the efforts of 
the royal navy to counter-attack [Music]  
norway and sweden were countries walking the 
tightrope of neutrality in a war which depended  
on internationally traded materials it would 
be increasingly difficult to remain neutral  
and have neutrality respected if germany violated 
norwegian neutrality so did britain and france  
at the same time as the attack upon 
norway the nazis turned against denmark  
denmark had remained a neutral country 
in every european affair since 1815  
and was accepted by all powers 
as part of germany's backyard
denmark was by nature pacifist in politics 
with the military held in low regard in 1940  
the danish army was just 14 000 strong the navy 
just five ships the air force 50 planes [Music]
the invasion of denmark began at 4 15 a.m on 
the morning of april 9th the danish government  
capitulated just one hour and 45 minutes later 
denmark was attacked because it was in the way  
an innocent bystander in the path of the attack 
upon norway [Music] all the countries that  
were to come under occupation in the war had to 
choose how to deal with their conqueror [Music]  
denmark chose the path of least resistance 
as a result of the capitulation the danish  
government retained power over denmark's internal 
affairs the price was what some call collaboration  
yet it was a policy supported by elections for 
the danish population it was a recipe for survival
norway had hoped to remain neutral although 
a country comparable in size to denmark  
its armed forces were stronger and the country 
was to provide a stronger resistance to the nazis
norway had its own nancy party and its leader 
vitkun quizling was installed by the germans as  
president of the occupied norway his name was to 
become synonymous with treachery and collaboration  
as he tried to impose a nazi system on his 
country as the germans mounted their invasion  
their troops embarked their aircraft 
and ships fueled and armed they were   taking part in a carefully planned operation to 
grab resources needed to further fight the war  
history conceals from us the confusion endured 
by both sides in 1940 if there is a lesson of  
military history it's the way in which the 
most extensively planned operations simply do  
not turn out as planned the fighting in norway 
became caught up in just such confusion as the  
german forces sailed up the coast they encountered 
british forces not a defense they were involved in  
an offensive operation of their own there had been 
intensive pressure in britain to end the phony war  
to do something britain and france had 
decided unbeknownst to germany to lay mines  
in norway's coastal waters the aim was to force 
german shipping out from norway's neutral waters  
into the open sea where they could become victim 
to british destroyers and submarines [Music]
the mining operation ran into the german invasion 
hastily the british revived the plan to occupy  
norway it was planned badly poorly controlled and 
from the first to last an operation conducted in  
a climate of confusion the action started badly 
units embarked on ships got off their ships were  
ordered back aboard leaving behind their heavy 
artillery an amphibious operation it was planned  
by admirals and generals who so jealously kept 
their independence they traveled on separate ships  
the fighting was to be amongst the 
sub-arctic mountains and fjords of norway   yet ordinary british infantry was pitted in 
combat against special mountain troops of germany  
troops were sent without anti-aircraft units only 
to be subjected to bear constant stuka attack
despite some determined action by the royal 
navy after having been initially caught off   guard when british destroyers completely 
devastated a large force of german ships  
the poorly equipped and organized 
british troops were pounded from the air   and driven to constant retreat by the mountain 
troops led by some of germany's best generals
[Music] after just two weeks of fighting the germans 
were in complete control of the south of norway  
and british and french troops 
were undertaking the first   of what were to be a series of 
desperate evacuations by sea
[Music] after six months of the phony war on 
april 6 as the germans were leading  
their invasion fleet for norway chamberlain 
had made a speech where he famously declared  
hitler has missed the bus chamberlain 
confidently predicted victory   arguing that hitler had failed to act while 
britain and france were still arming for war  
once again chamberlain's words were soon to be 
ridiculed by events as the war began for real  
a debate in britain's house of commons was called 
to discuss the norwegian campaign the house met  
for two days in continuous session member 
after member rose to criticize chamberlain  
aged war heroes came to the house in uniform 
and medals and stood in condemnation famously  
leo amri one of the most senior members 
from chamberlain's own conservative party  
quoted words from oliver cromwell 
spoken in the house 200 years previously  
pointing at chamberlain he said you have sat 
too long for any good you have been doing  
depart i say and let us have done with you in the 
name of god go a vote followed chamberlain's party  
deserted him and the government's majority of 200 
was cut to 81. the result stunned chamberlain and  
visibly shaken he left the house with chants 
of go go go resounding in the chamber [Music]  
the british parliament turned to winston churchill 
the only politician not tainted by appeasement of  
the thirties churchill's leadership was to be 
put to the greatest trial from the very start
on the 13th of may 1940 on taking office prime 
minister winston churchill's message to his new  
government to the parliament and the people of 
britain mirrored the plight of their country  
powerless to make any move that could threaten 
the nazi state churchill gave no quick and easy  
solution he offered no hint of any possible 
compromise accommodation or understanding  
no promise of any appeasement i have nothing 
to offer but blood toil tears and sweat he said
churchill had come to power as the british 
war effort had collapsed into chaos in norway  
if the situation had seemed grave enough the 
fortunes of britain and her continental allies  
immediately plunged to new 
depths of [Music] despair
in the very hours the churchill was taking office 
in europe war was about to burst on the west  
a german attack began across 
the whole of the western border   from the sea to switzerland in the north german 
armies swept into the netherlands in belgium
[Music]
[Music]  
in the south 17 divisions were hurled 
against the fortresses and the defenders  
of the french maginot line the territory 
into which the german armies marched was  
for the great part that which had been fought over 
a generation before in 1940 as in 1914 a small  
highly professional british army took 
its place alongside the french [Music]  
however the war in 1940 was to be far different 
to that fought in 1914 it was a war where movement  
replaced static immobility where the front line 
moved tens of miles every day a war where even  
the words the front line came to have little 
meaning where the safe area in the rear could  
in ours become enemy territory in seconds 
become a tortured hell of aerial bombardment  
the word that history uses for this type of war is 
blitz green blitzkrieg was a word new to the world  
it's a word born of the 20th century 
its first recorded use was 1939  
and since then has passed into nearly every 
language of the world blitz lightning creed war  
blitzcream was known as the lightning war to 
understand how blitzkrieg came about as with  
so many of the events of world war ii is 
to understand the impact of world war one  
in 1940 that this war of incredible mobility 
was played out upon the same stages where only  
30 years previously an entire generation died 
moving backwards and forwards over the same  
shattered few miles of earth only 
emphasized the shock of the new  
throughout the history of human conflict from the 
first time a club was swung in anger the advantage  
in war has swung between the extremes of offense 
and defense those primitive peoples who first used  
clubs had the advantage but were bettered when 
met by those who had also invented the shield
the cycles of offense versus defense have 
continued throughout the history of warfare  
to this present day in world war one the 
perfection of just one weapon the machine  
gun had given the defense a crushing advantage two 
men in protected positions could resist a thousand  
the result was stalemate as neither side 
could mount a decisive attack [Music]  
the first tanks had appeared in the later 
stages of the great war lumbering and clumsy  
they had crawled their way across the mud the 
trenches and the barbed wire of no man's land  
their contribution to allied victory was not clear 
over so many of the leaders of the second world  
war hung the shadows and ghosts of 1914 in the 
great war generals on both sides bereft of ideas  
had in despair resorted to the logic of 
attrition the aim was not to defeat the  
enemy simply to destroy to kill soldiers it was 
a strategy expressed as bleeding the enemy white
[Music]   when the first world war was over historians and 
military theorists all over the world sought to  
draw lessons winners always tend to think that 
the same tactics and weapons that won the last war  
will win the next france thought the lessons of 
the war were that the defense had the upper hand  
that the machine gun the entrenched soldier 
had the advantage they sought to defend france  
by building a line of defenses all along the 
border with germany this was the maginot line  
most accurately described as the western front 
cast and set into concrete and steel a complex of  
forts with protected underground roads miniature 
railway systems and deep bunkers as barracks
the victorious armies of britain and france saw 
the tank and the aircraft as just another weapon  
to be fitted into existing ways of fighting 
war tanks were attached to cavalry units  
tanks were ordered to support the infantry the 
result was that tanks moved at the pace of men  
marching on foot at the same speed as 
horse-drawn transport and artillery  
their job to knock out machine guns 
so infantry could make a bayonet   charge on foot and cavalry could 
gallop to attack with sabers drawn
it would be completely wrong to 
suppose that the british and the french   ignored the tank tanks in fact made up 
large numbers of both countries armies  
the weakness lay in the minds of the commanders 
in the theories and ideas of war [Music]  
air forces in britain and france were seen in 
the light of futuristic theories of imagined   wars that could be won by air power alone where 
unstoppable bomber forces would bring devastation  
to the centers of population and industry the air 
force officers of britain and france encouraged  
these ideas they meant air forces were independent 
free from interference by generals or admirals
britain and france were the winners of world war 
one germany had suffered national disaster the  
terms of the versailles peace treaty had destroyed 
the once proud german military the german military  
mind was open to new ideas rejecting the old 
ways of thinking that it failed to bring victory  
nazism national socialism believed itself the 
politics of the future with an ideology of  
newness which readily embraced modern theories 
and ideas it was in this fertile and receptive  
environment that the new technologies were 
realized to create the blitzkrieg the idea was  
to create an armored and mechanized army in which 
all elements moved at the speed of the fastest  
not the slowest where infantry and artillery 
were mechanized and could keep up with the tanks  
where airborne soldiers and paratroopers could be 
landed behind enemy lines where the air force was  
not independent fighting its own private war but 
was instead dedicated to the support of the army  
with aircraft designed to attack tactical targets 
troop formations and supply lines in support of  
ground attack the german luftwaffe was by no 
means the ultimate fighting organization that  
its propagandists claimed by the end of 1940 its 
weakness would have been laid bare to the world  
but in the early summer the luftwaffe 
stood at the peak of its strength and effectiveness under the determined well of the 
nazi administration with active preparation  
for war in mind germany had focused on producing 
just a few highly effective and advanced aircraft  
in britain and france the air forces 
were equipped with an assortment of types   some obsolete some useless [Music] the luftwaffe's 
leadership its officers were of a high standard  
in germany it was an honor and a mark of 
competence to transfer from army to air force  
in britain and france such a move was a 
way for the incompetent to restart a career
despite the modernity of the means of 
war blitzkrieg had at its heart classic  
military theory ideas which would have been 
understood by the greatest commanders of the past  
alexander the great genghis khan napoleon 
blitzkrieg was not a strategy of wounding  
the enemy of destroying him but of 
techniques of hitting at the decisive point  
of rapid fluid maneuver that could respond to 
the will of quick thinking generals blitzkrieg  
was a strategy of encirclement and of surprise in 
which victory would go to the quick and the skill
the german word for armor is panzer germany 
created specialist panzer divisions which with  
close air support and airborne soldiers were 
to act as the spearheads for german attacks  
penetrating deeply behind enemy lines 
outflanking and surrounding the enemy  
the german army still had traditional elements 
slower divisions of foot and horse that reduced  
and destroyed the pockets surrounded and cut off 
by the panzers panzer warfare blitzkrieg made real  
the soldiers nightmare to be surrounded to be 
cut off from home and safety to have no way out
on may 10 the forces of britain and france 
outnumbered those of germany germany had a  
total of 2400 tanks the french 3000 
and the british 1000 yet on that day  
hitler told his generals gentlemen you are about 
to witness the most famous victory in history
in the south lay the maginot line fortifications 
against which the strongest of forces would find  
it difficult to prevail this was where 
the french expected an attack [Music]
as a diversion the germans threw masses of 
ordinary non-mechanized and non-armored troops  
against the line the national fortifications 
did not extend across the belgian frontier  
oppa said these areas in northern 
france stood the best of the french army   and the entire british army guarding 
against a strike that would seek to bypass  
and outflank the national line and thrust to the 
rear towards paris this was what germany had done  
in 1914 invading neutral belgium to outflank the 
french however in 1940 the thrust came farther to  
the north into holland and northern belgium the 
french and british moved to meet the invasion  
the northern attack was bait an 
enticement and a provocation it  
was designed to draw the british and french 
to the north into a trap into destruction
as the western allies moved north silently quietly 
through the dense forest of the ardennes came a  
third german attack this concentrated the german 
panzer armies in one massive tank-based formation  
the british and the french thought tanks could 
not work in the wooded country of the ardennes  
they could and did creeping slowly through 
narrow forest lanes eventually to burst out  
into open countryside as this silent menace grew 
the first weight of the attack fell upon the dutch  
in the north the dutch were genuine neutrals and 
surprise was complete a tiny army protected the  
netherlands just 10 divisions strong it was an 
army that had not been in the field since 1830  
the dutch air force was a mere 125 planes strong 
and was half destroyed on the ground in the first  
hours of the assault the dutch historically 
had retreated behind barriers of water  
german airborne troops simply bypassed these 
defenses on may 13th the luftwaffe against  
no resistance destroyed the historic center of 
the city of rotterdam and the dutch surrendered
[Music]
[Music]  
still the british and french advanced 
toward the north to a decisive battle  
hitler was to say of the campaign as he received 
reports of the british and french advancing  
it was wonderful the way everything 
turned out according to plan   when the news came through that the enemy 
were moving forward along the whole front  
i could have wept for joy they had fallen into the 
trap they had believed on may 13th the british and  
french armies were deep into belgium and holland 
and the third german attack burst in their rear  
accelerating to open country moving at tremendous 
speed the panzer armies swung around to the west  
attacking the channel ports giving the british 
and the very best of the french no way out [Music]
by may 25th catastrophe faced the entire british 
army the entire british war effort was placed in  
the gravest peril as the british expeditionary 
force was nearly surrounded in the great war  
another british expeditionary force had doggedly 
defended this small patch of europe for four years  
in 1940 in just weeks fast moving panzer armies 
broke the british line circled around to their  
rear and threatened to surround the british 
denying them a way out by holding the channel  
ports the result would be that the entire army 
britain had raised would be lost in mass surrender
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
only one door one way home across the 
sea lay slightly open this was the french  
port of dunkirk the royal navy 
began to organize the army's escape  
to close the trap all the germans had to do was 
take dunkirk the days between may 26 and june 3rd  
number among the most important in the history 
of the world a point in the timeline of humanity  
where the actions of a single man a single mind 
a single will has a decisive influence on all  
that happens ever after within the encircled 
board were both british and french troops  
that the british were planning escape was a fact 
at first hidden from the french french troops were  
refused evacuation and in ugly confrontations 
british soldiers opened fire on their allies
the panzer armies stood outside dunkirk 
they had paused to reorganize regain their  
formations and shape and were ready to make the 
final assault on the port their generals ready  
eagerly awaiting the order to attack the order 
was to come from adolf hitler and that command  
was crucially delayed for 48 hours was it a 
mistake or did hitler fear he risked his forces  
did he not understand how close his dark ambition 
lay to fulfillment or was it simply loss of nerve  
hitler wanted to completely destroy and 
humiliate the french but saw in britain  
a potential friend and dreamed of his european 
empire allied with the british overseas empire  
confronting and destroying the forces of stalin's 
communism in the east of course there were other  
factors that stayed the german armies french 
armies fought fierce covering attacks to win time  
the luftwaffe wanted to prove that it could 
defeat the british without ground forces [Music]  
the result of hitler's hesitation was what history 
has come to know as the miracle of dunkirk dunkirk  
mobilized the british talent for improvisation 
for pulling in unity during crisis that side  
of the british personality that is dogged 
that refuses to give in which adversity only  
inspires to ever stronger resistance a hastily 
gathered fleet of small vestments pleasure ships  
small boats used by ordinary people for weekend 
holidays crossed the channel and helped rescue  
the army from the beaches under the guns and bombs 
of the third reich abject defeat was turned into  
a kind of triumph a kind of victory of course the 
ships of the royal navy were the central element  
of the effort in the saving of the army but the 
lasting image is of civilians ordinary people of  
the man next door volunteering to climb into tiny 
craft designed for pleasure on sunny days crossing  
a hostile sea to save soldiers from exposed 
and open beaches under remorseless air attack  
a total of 338 000 soldiers escaped over the sea 
after the british 100 000 french were taken all  
heavy equipment was lost vast stores of artillery 
transport and tanks fell into german hands  
men even threw away helmets and rifles in escape 
but helmets rifles and tanks can be replaced  
dunkirk turned crushing and humiliating 
defeat into a version of victory dunkirk  
was demonstration of the british will to endure 
and in the end prevail dunkirk was one of the  
events of the dark days of the war that gave the 
british people belief in their future the possible  
course of history had hitler closed the trap is 
stunning to contemplate britain would have had to  
surrender the war might have ended and the british 
empire become ally to hitler's tyranny and evil
with the escape of the british in june belgium 
too capitulated and surrendered to the german  
occupation with nazi armies just 20 miles off sea 
from british territory churchill again repeated  
a message of defiance in one of his most famous 
speeches he once again took words and forged them  
into weapons we shall go on to the end we shall 
fight in france we shall fight on the sea and  
oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and 
growing strength in the air we shall defend our  
island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on 
the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds  
we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we 
shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender
while churchill issued forth with belligerent 
defiance the role of nazi victory continued  
the campaign in norway came to a close 
as that country surrendered on june 4th  
hitler's northern flank was secure and sweden 
although neutral was insulated from the war  
secure from british interference and falling 
firmly into the axis sphere of influence
in france the forces of germany had turned south 
to deal with the french the remaining soldiers  
were from the reserve divisions of the french army 
poorly equipped badly trained and of low morale  
it was an army that marched on foot that 
napoleon bonaparte would have recognized
on june 9th the french government appealed to 
american president roosevelt to act as mediator  
he refused saying he could have 
no influence on european events  
the next day italy entered the war mussolini's 
armies invading southern [Music] france
mussolini was simply eager to make sure of 
a share of the spoils not to be left out  
in the victory in the united states mussolini's 
opportunism caused revulsion the cynical nature  
of the attack added to the slowly growing 
swell of american opposition to the axis  
italy's first involvement in the fighting could 
have been taken as a warning that italy would   prove an eventual liability to the nazi fascist 
alliance the french troops opposing the italians  
in the south beat off the invasion and only the 
later collapse against german forces attacking  
from the north prevented an embarrassing repulse 
for the italians [Music] in france an impending  
sense of crisis caused the government to 
recall to office a hero of the great war  
marshall philippe had been the hero of 1915 
and 1960 at the height of the battle of verdun  
an earlier dark hour of crisis his simple message 
of defiance the famous words in the passage they  
shall not pass had become a battle cry this spirit 
of defiance reflected that offered by churchill  
tragically the pata of 1940 was not the same man 
as the hero of 1915 the guilt of many thousands of  
lives lost their last dying words that battle 
cry weighed heavy on the old man's shoulders  
immediately suggested a peace with hitler on june 
10th the french government fled paris and declared  
the city open hoping by doing so to prevent 
the capital being fought over and destroyed  
churchill urged them to fight in the streets 
of paris to never surrender but he was ignored  
a week later on june 17th paris was open for 
business as usual only the tourists enjoying  
the summer were germans at the same time as some 
frenchmen served their conquerors drinks others  
were still fighting ironically the maginot line 
had proved impregnable secure until the very last  
the germans forced the 
french to sign the surrender   in the preserved railway car that had seen 
the german capitulation in 1918 this was  
just one of a series of vengeful humiliations 
which hitler was to inflict upon his enemy
[Music]   on june 14th the population of paris endured the 
site of the vermont marching in triumph down the  
champs-elysees the surrender terms that hitler 
imposed on the french were revenge and retribution  
for the humiliation of the treaty of versailles 
a humiliation that the corporal decorated  
for bravery on the western front had felt so 
keenly the french army was reduced to 100 000  
the cost of the german occupation 
was to be borne by the french [Music]  
hitler famously went sightseeing 
in the french capital
on the other side of the continent of 
europe yet another opportunist state   took its chance the soviet union invaded 
and extinguished the independence of the  
tiny baltic states of latvia lithuania and 
estonia annexing them into the ussr [Music]  
on june 17th patta was made premiere of a new 
french government which had made peace with hitler  
with a base in the southern french town of vichy 
the vichy regime was to become a byword for  
collaboration and betrayal on june 18th another 
frenchman charles de gaulle made a broadcast from  
london to the french people he boldly declared 
that the war was not over and the french must  
resist he denied that the vichy regime had any 
legitimacy de gaulle story truly proves that there  
is such a thing as destiny de gaulle was a devout 
catholic and fierce patriot three times wounded  
in the first world war he spent much of that 
conflict as a prisoner of the germans his life  
until world war ii was spent as an unspectacular 
career soldier he wrote books about armored  
mechanized war but his ideas found no acceptance 
in the french military in 1940 he was made the  
commander of a division that was forming which had 
some minor successes as the french army crumbled  
on june 6 he was appointed a junior defense 
minister in the hastily reorganized government  
he was a minister for just ten days but during 
that short period he met and impressed winston  
churchill when the french government resigned 
on june 16th de gaulle was smuggled into the uk  
at churchill's personal insistence 
his famous broadcast was made  
de gaulle became recognized as the head of the 
free french and began to mastermind a strategy of  
striking back at the axis from wherever possible 
most notably the far-flung corners of the french  
colonial empire remote corners of the world 
declared war against vichy and the axis [Music]
de gaulle saw his duty as a religious 
calling events impose this sacred duty on me  
i shall not fail to carry it out he said de 
gaulle would in the coming years boldly fight  
as the leader of a free people mounting actions 
independent of his allies through strong  
self-belief he refused to become subject to 
britain and acted as an independent leader  
patel's government tried to call for desertion 
and in his absence condemned him to death [Music]  
the 100 000 free french were just the largest 
group of defiant exiles that had refused to  
surrender to the germans and by roundabout 
routes had escaped from occupied europe   and found their way to britain to carry on 
the war a czechoslovak brigade 5 000 strong  
existed as part of the british army four 
squadrons of the raf flew with check markings
[Music] the polish armed forces made up an 
even more sizable number of anti-nazi forces  
in 1940 there were 14 000 soldiers numerous 
naval and merchant ships and five squadrons  
in the polish air force in the coming 
battle of britain polish pilots were to  
be among the most resolute courageous and 
successful destroyers of german attackers
[Music]   in early july an engagement was fought which 
demonstrated to the world that churchill's  
defiance was not just words the french fleet 
the fourth largest in the world lay at anchor  
having hardly seen action the british feared the 
vichy government would surrender these ships and  
place them at the disposal of the germans the 
royal navy sent a powerful fleet to lie off  
the ports in which the french fleet lay and 
the french admirals were given hard choices  
put to sea and join the british in a combined 
fleet scuttled their ships or be destroyed
the french admiralty refused to comply and 
ordered all ships at sea to move to the ports  
where the main fleet lay to confront with the 
british the royal navy intercepted the message  
and the british ships opened fire the french ships 
at anchor were easy targets and the bulk of the  
vichy navy was destroyed nearly 1300 french 
sailors died creating a legacy of bitterness
[Music] churchill's words were turned into action 
britain really would pay any price to [Music]
survive on august 5th italian 
troops invaded british somalia  
from their neighboring east african colony 
the motivation for war was once more  
mussolini's ego and passionate ravenous hunger 
for conquest to add to his new roman empire  
the fighting between european powers and european 
ideologies was spreading over the surface of the  
planet to embroil all peoples men were to 
fight and die in all corners of the earth
the fall of france had a wide effect on the 
conduct of the war affecting the war of resources  
the war of economic and industrial strength it 
has been said that all wars have at their root the  
control of resources of food of raw materials of 
manufactured products including weapons themselves  
the possession of these resources 
is as important in bringing victory   as much as number and quality of armies navies 
and air forces the preconditions of the war of  
resources was not in britain's favor in 1939 
germany was self-sufficient in food and most  
raw materials her supplies of energy were 
based on coal oils she had to import but  
advanced science and technology meant that 
coal-based substitutes for oil could be found  
in britain the position was far different 
britain was a trading nation which looked  
out to the rest of the world its merchant fleet 
the largest britain needed to import no less than  
55 million tons of goods of all kinds each year 
to survive compared to germany's self-sufficiency  
that merchant fleet had to bring wheat from north 
america meat from south america and australia  
if all shipping imports to england were halted it 
would take a mere few months to completely starve  
britain to death at the outbreak of war the huge 
british royal navy had thrown a tight blockade  
around germany closing the narrow gaps of the 
channel and the north sea german naval strength  
was trapped their warships facing a long tortuous 
journey before being able to attack british trade  
as france fell this ground which determined naval 
strategy shifted with the occupation of france  
the germans could use the french atlantic ports 
from where 100 years before napoleon's navy threw  
down its challenge to the british another struggle 
in which britain struggled for life or death  
against a continental dictator german u-boats 
could now have easy access to the clear  
deep blue water of the ocean as soon as a u-boat 
left french coastal waters it entered the shipping  
lanes that brought oil from africa and the 
middle east that carried armies to britain's  
overseas empire over which flowed strategic 
materials without which the raf could not  
fly sail a short distance further and were 
found the ships bearing food from the americas
germany was poorly prepared to take advantage of 
this the u-boat numbers initially only slowly grew
churchill was to say after the war that the u-boat 
war was the war that truly terrified him not a war  
of flaring battles and glittering achievements 
but a fight of statistics diagrams and curves  
that the public did not understand a war where 
inspiring words and spirit could have no effect
with the fall of france britain and her empire 
stood completely alone against hitler the only  
weapon was belligerent defiance time and time 
again churchill made words into sharp weapons  
let us brace ourselves to our duties and so bear 
ourselves that if the british empire and its  
commonwealth last for a thousand years men will 
still say this was their finest hour if we fail  
then the whole world including the 
united states will sink into the abyss   of a new dark age made more sinister and more 
protracted by the lights of perverted science
britain could have no strategy other than survival 
churchill's hopes lay in involving america in  
the conflict all over the south of england 
invasion was awaited preparations were made
the famous home guard of those two old and too 
young for military service was recruited it gave  
all a sense of involvement with the passing 
of time the measures of improvised weapons  
now seems comedic the stuff of farce [Music] 
from within the home guard a highly secret  
elite of stay behind saboteurs was given 
special training to work from secret hideouts
that an army of old men and boys 
were preparing to defend their homes   against the might of the german army the most 
modern in the world using spears and antiques  
is a measure of the desperate plight 
which faced the british people [Music]  
in the course of your duty you may have 
the luck to come in contact with the enemy  
if you do one of your duties is to shoot when you 
see a sitter and shoot to kill when in later years  
the home guard's german equivalent was called into 
real action with the aged and children fighting  
experienced battle-hardened soldiers there were to 
be no jokes no comedy simply a desperate tragedy
a general atmosphere of fear and 
tension pervaded the whole of britain   with a feverish climate of paranoia both the 
physical and social structures of britain were  
torn apart road signs were removed to confuse an 
invading enemy fields were filled with obstacles  
to hamper glider and airborne forces wild 
experiments were made to set the sea on fire what  
became known as parachute fever everywhere created 
rumors of saboteurs and infiltrators while stories  
of germans in british uniforms circulated often 
caused by misunderstood polish and czech soldiers  
the classic myth was that of german paratroopers 
walking the british countryside disguised as nuns
the forces of nazism stand at the edge of victory 
in the summer of 1940 in a tumultuous few months  
the phony war had burst into a 
dramatic and terrifying real war  
the spring and early summer of 1940 had 
brought the british people nothing but bad news  
the british armed forces and their allies 
nothing but defeat after crushing defeat  
the continent of europe had fallen rapidly 
before the blitzkrieg of the panzer armies  
holland belgium and france had all 
surrendered in the space of weeks  
the french were nationally humiliated as 
the vermont marched down the champs-elysees
with the entire british army in france nearly 
encircled their backs to the sea a mysterious  
moment of indecision by hitler had saved 
one-third of a million british and french soldiers  
evacuated from the beaches of dunkirk 
by an armada of small boats and ships  
in britain the country and the people awaited 
invasion by the nazi armies the south coast of  
england was turned into a fortified camp the home 
guard of old men and boys was hastily recruited  
and stood waiting with desperately improvised 
weapons the very structure and fabric of the  
country was broken up to fuel the war effort 
to build planes tanks and ships the population  
awaited the ringing of church bells which 
would be the signal that the invasion had begun  
fear rumor and paranoia infested the british 
people as spies and infiltration were seen  
everywhere [Music] elsewhere the world seemed 
to be turning its back on britain and her empire  
the soviet union had extinguished 
the independence of the baltic states   content that hitler had given the soviet 
system a free reign in the east fascist  
italy had joined the war the rome berlin axis was 
now a military as well as a political alliance  
the united states remained steadfast and 
resolute in its neutrality churchill promised  
britain's enemies that they would be fought on 
the beaches that britain would never surrender
in the high summer of 1940 the battle for the 
survival of britain and of freedom in europe   was not being fought on the beaches within 
the clear blue skies of southern england  
the story of the battle of britain is a story 
of weapons a technological story as much as it  
is a story of collective national heroism 
and the individual courage of young men  
in this it is a retelling of an old tale [Music] 
since the very earliest days of warfare of human  
conflict the need to survive the need to defend 
yourself against your enemy has spurred the  
invention innovation and the creation of ever 
more destructive and more terrible weapons  
and the weapon that hits harder faster or 
further has always been countered by either an  
even more powerful weapon or by a better defense 
better armor a better shield better ways to hide
to understand the battle of britain we must look 
back before the war when military thinkers all  
over the world were imagining we're theorizing 
about future conflicts at the turn of the century  
it can be hard to realize that the invention 
of powered flight is an event that exists just  
still within living memory that flight of 
wilbur and orville wright was only in 1903.  
in the interwar years aircraft were just one of 
a series of breathtaking inventions miracles of  
science that had amazed the world their role in 
warfare during the conflict of world war one had  
grown in 1914 the flying machines were consigned 
to reconnaissance to acting as spotters and spies  
by 1918 the war had pushed the technology forward 
and specialized aircraft war machines bombers  
and fighters have developed the great war had 
seen the first strategic bombings of civilian  
and industrial targets ordinary people far 
from the front where army struggled experienced  
the terror of aerial attack by that war's end 
the technology had advanced such that in 1919  
a british strategic bomber was able to make 
the first crossing of the atlantic ocean  
military theorists seized at the airplane 
as a decisive weapon that could change the  
nature of warfare forever as a way out of the 
horrors of trench warfare politicians saw the  
airplane as an awesome machine that could win wars 
cleanly without casualties in a matter of days  
it was believed by politicians and soldiers in all 
countries that the bomber would always get through
between the wars it was widely believed that the 
next war would be fought with a short air battle  
where one side's air force would be defeated 
conceding air supremacy then under threat of  
absolute destruction from bombers victory would 
be conceded without any actual bombing of cities  
taking place perhaps warnings would be dropped 
into the centers of industry and populations   would be evacuated in panic and then denied to the 
enemy by the use of poison gas because the theory  
held no same government would risk devastation 
in this way wars in the future would be clean  
short with minimal deaths and destruction [Music] 
experience between the wars had seemed to prove  
that the bomber would always get through and that 
air power would result in the predicted victory
nazi bombers in support of franco in the 
spanish civil war had brought apocalyptic   devastation upon spanish republican cities 
the fate of the basque city of guernica  
was held up as a warning to the world of 
aerial power the british royal air force  
had ruthlessly used bombing to economically 
and painlessly without british casualties  
police the wilder parts of the british empire 
bombing the villages of rebellious tribes in  
arabia and afghanistan sparing the cost 
and the risk of british ground troops  
during the 1930s the italian air force had 
used aircraft and poison gas to subdue the   forces of emperor haile selassie in ethiopia 
of course these easy successes were an illusion  
the spanish republican government had no air 
force no air defense system that could deal   with what were state-of-the-art german aircraft 
guernica was a soft undefended target the tribe's  
people that the royal air force intimidated had 
no air defense no shelters and no fighters the raf  
even had the luxury of marking gigantic figures 
and directions on the surface to aid navigation  
the ethiopian society that italy attacked 
was medieval in its structure and technology
[Music]   even so the second world war up to 
the onset of the battle of britain  
had seemed to prove that 
air power was irresistible  
soldiers from poland to france across the entire 
continent had cowered fled in panic and died  
under a morseless attack by german aircraft 
in close support of advancing german armies
again this success was not a proof   of the air power theories the use of aircraft 
as close support to land forces is a long way  
removed from strategic air power used by one 
industrialized advanced country to defeat another
the blitzkrieg that had swept across 
europe was a new way of making war   but it was a theory that combined tanks 
flames and infantry to defeat the enemy's army
in the battle of britain for the first time air 
power was on its own in an individual struggle  
air force versus air force unaffected by 
the needs of soldiers and sailors [Music]
[Music]
history likes to assign dates 
to the start and end of events   rarely are events seen at the time so clearly the 
battle of britain began at the instant that the  
battle of france ended all through july of 
1940 there were skirmishes between fighters  
minor raids as the two air forces fenced feeling 
for their enemies weaknesses hitler named august  
13th as eagle day when the main assault 
was to begin hitler's fuhrer directive 17  
ordered the luftwaffe to overpower the english air 
force with all the forces at its command in the  
shortest possible time to attack the flying units 
ground installations and supply organizations  
and the aircraft industry the objective of 
the german air force on eagle day was simple  
to destroy the british royal air force completely 
then the luftwaffe would be able to attack at will  
striking anywhere anytime it would have air 
supremacy with air supremacy the british navy  
would be powerless to prevent the german army's 
proposed river crossing of the english channel  
operation sea lion the invasion and 
conquest of the british isles would begin  
all over northern france and the low countries 
the luftwaffe gathered all its strength  
the ancient chinese philosopher of war tsum 
tsu held that every battle is won or lost  
before it is fought that every factor determining 
the outcome of a conflict is already in place in  
the men in the weapons in the geography in 
the minds and the plans of the commanders  
in that summer of 1940 as the 
two air forces prepared to fight   each had their strengths and weaknesses the 
raf was small numbering little more than 600  
fighters the british bomber force 
was to be irrelevant in the battle
but the fighter planes were the twin legends 
of the war the spitfire and the hurricane
the hurricane was a devastating attacker of the 
german bombers its armament and its design caused  
heavy losses to the luftwaffe forces once the 
pilot had the enemy in his sights the hurricane  
made kills easily and quickly the hurricane was 
a dependable strong aircraft that made its pilots  
feel safe its body was sturdy and the plane could 
resist punishment and damage and get the man home
the spitfire was undoubtedly 
the most beautiful air around   the smooth lines came from the natural needs of 
aerodynamics and were made possible by advanced  
revolutionary technology the spitfire by 
far the faster and most agile its flying  
qualities meant spitfires were the planes of 
choice to engage the opposing german fighters  
a myth of the war was that the spitfire 
won the battle of britain for the raf  
the truth was that hurricanes were far more 
numerous and shot down many more german aircraft
hurricanes were far easier and cheaper 
to build and the better destroyers of   bombers the two aircraft together were 
to be the twin nemesis of the [Music]
luftwaffe
the luftwaffe however possessed numerical 
superiority a huge force of bombers more than one  
thousand aircraft strong built to three designs 
the heinkel 111 the dornier 17 and the ju-88
the heinkel and the dornier both suffered from 
light bomb loads and poor defensive armament  
the heinkel's peculiar nose design made its crews 
feel intensely vulnerable the yonkers 88 was the  
best german bomber only slightly slower than the 
british hurricane and although a small aircraft  
could deliver its bombs very accurately as its 
airframe could take the stresses of dive bombing
all were medium bombers not capable of carrying 
the devastating bomb load seen later in the war  
it was to be a major failing of germany that 
its aviation industry never produced a working  
heavy four engine bomber the type that was 
to prove so destructive later in the war
as so often the vanity and pride of 
the nazi dictatorship was its downfall  
the small medium bomber enabled a huge 
air force to be cheaply and quickly built  
masses of the medium-sized planes were more 
impressive as they flew over the nuremberg rallies
in addition to the three medium bombers 
there were 300 stuka dive bombers  
their distinctive wing shape the result of 
a design capable of near vertical dives that  
enabled a light bomb load to be delivered 
with deadly accuracy they were slow and  
clumsy planes in normal flight and while these 
aircraft had terrified soldiers on the ground  
they were yet to be tested in 
an air force to air force battle
[Music]
[Music]  
the other arm of the luftwaffe's strength was its 
fighters at the start of the battle of britain  
the luftwaffe was equipped with two machines the 
measureschmidt 110 was a twin-engined and heavily  
armed fighter and its crews were regarded 
by the nazi leadership as the elite of the  
luftwaffe in fact the most dangerous adversary 
of the raf in 1940 was the measureschmidt 109  
a single-seat single-engine fighter the equal 
of the spitfire and faster than the hurricane
the angular lines of the 109 made it less 
naturally agile than the spitfire but the  
heart of the aircraft its engine gave the 
german plane its own advantages in air combat  
evenly matched in speed and armament 
for as long as the war is remembered   the argument will be which was the best whether 
spitfire or me109 was the superior fighter  
the total strength of the luftwaffe was over 
1 000 bombers and more than 800 fighters  
against which the royal air force could 
muster 600 spitfires and hurricanes  
there was far more to the technology of the 
battle of britain than simple statistics of   bomb load and rate of climb of top speed 
turning circle and weight and rate of fire  
the battle could be won and lost in the aircraft 
factories the battle of britain was a battle  
of attrition the side that lost most planes 
that lost the more pilots would be defeated  
with equal losses on either side the 
side that could build and replace   lost planes the quicker would 
in the end be the victor [Music]  
a fact of history is that in the summer of 
1940 the british factories could easily out  
produce the germans 500 spitfires and hurricanes 
could leave the production line every month the  
german figure was less than half that [Music] 
attrition of machines and attrition of pilots  
the most advanced aircraft in the world is a 
sword of cardboard if no pilot can be found to fly  
and fight with the aircraft fighters like the 
109 and the spitfire were demanding planes to  
fly needing skilled pilots the spitfire's 
speed agility and responsiveness to control  
would terrify the beginner in this the germans 
had the edge huge numbers of conscripted young  
men passed through the luftwaffe in the 1930s 
and germany could call on 10 000 qualified pilots  
in comparison britain had just over 2 000 
young men scraped together from amateurs  
university flying clubs and the remnants of the 
polish and the czech air forces the raf could  
train only 50 new pilots a week [Music] yet the 
technology of the battle had another dimension  
radar the story of radar is a classic example 
of how human inventiveness makes connections  
in between the wars a serious question 
was asked of british aircraft research  
could radio waves be used as death 
rays stalling the engines of enemy  
aircraft or boiling the blood of pilots both 
of which were thought theoretically possible  
the scientific reply was that radio waves 
could not be made strong enough to do such  
things they would just bounce off but a 
connection was made flying aircraft were  
causing problem interference with transmitters 
of the bbc and the idea of radar was born  
between the wars finding and tracking 
incoming attacking aircraft was thought   an impossibility and was central to the belief 
that the bomber would always get through  
the use of radar was to give the raf the 
crucial advantage in the battle of britain  
it would be wrong to suppose that britain 
alone had radar in 1940 all major countries  
had radar programs but british work was the most 
advanced most importantly britain understood what  
the new technology meant had worked out how 
to use radar how to process the information  
and use the intelligence gathered to control and 
direct fighters towards incoming bombers britain  
was the only country which at the outbreak of war 
had built a complete network of radar stations  
germany did not realize the value and importance 
of the technology their own experiments in radar  
were leading in different ways that blinded them 
to the value of the british system still yet more  
factors determined the way the battle would be 
fought and the ability of each side to win victory
the battle was fought in british skies german 
aircraft had less time over their targets before  
needing to return rearm and refuel down german 
pilots and damaged aircraft were lost forever  
british madness machines 
could be returned to action   in so many ways the two air 
forces were evenly matched  
strengths and weaknesses evened out in determining 
the chances of defeat or victory for both sides  
a weakness of the german side was their battle 
plan even though they knew their clear goal was  
the destruction of the raf germany's leaders 
had no clear idea as to how to achieve that aim  
the course of events in the skies of britain 
in the weeks of the campaign against the raf   were marked by abandonment and changes of plan 
improvisation and bad intelligence bad guesswork  
that seen with the standpoint of 
history brought ultimate german failure  
overall the germans believed that if they could 
bring the raf fighter force to a decisive battle  
they would destroy the fighters 
and the invasion could begin   luftwaffe leader goring called it the 
knockout punch hitler even hoped that  
once the raf was destroyed britain would see 
sense capitulate without the need for invasion
the battle of britain divides into a number 
of phases in the first phase on eagle day  
the luftwaffe attacked a wide variety of targets 
some airfields the naval dockyards at portsmouth  
shipping in the english channel some radar 
stations aircraft factories and so on  
the aim to rain blows everywhere to provoke 
the raf into a fight the raf held its own  
in this first phase and crucially the radar 
stations were not systematically attacked again  
after that first day german intelligence did 
not realize how effective the british system was  
the result was that the attacking forces 
were always met by british fighters
the skies of southern britain were full 
of aircraft the news reel showed proud   home guards standing over downed 
aircraft in the fields [Music]
[Music]
so
[Music] me [Music]
on august 20th in the british parliament 
prime minister winston churchill paid his   legendary tribute to the young pilots of the raf  
never in the field of human conflict 
was so much owed by so many to so few
the few and that was the point the pilots of 
the raf were few in number although britain  
was managing to replace the losses of aircraft 
the pilots were growing ever smaller in number
after two weeks the courage of the pilots 
and the technology of the planes and radar   meant that the expected result was not 
happening the raf was still in the air
from august 24th a new tactic emerged 
impatient for success the luftwaffe  
focused solely on attacking the raf's airfields 
the nazi thinking was that the raf surely would  
have to rise in its entire strength to defend 
itself and his own capability to fight the  
attacks were made by small groups of bombers 
accompanied by large formations of fighters  
with this strategy the luftwaffe began to 
slowly gain the upper hand at some bases the  
ground crew without which the raf could not fly 
were in mutiny refusing to come out of shelters  
for the first time the rate of destruction of 
raf planes was overtaking the rate at which   new fighters could be built in early september 
the situation was at breaking point for britain
on september 7th this strategy which was winning 
was dropped the germans suddenly mounted mass  
daylight raids on london impatience the victory 
was slow in coming caused the change again the  
idea was to provoke the raf into a mass defense 
of the capital and bring about decisive defeat  
the germans abandoned all subtlety of tactics of 
faints and diversionary raids and simply threw  
all their strength in mass attacks in increasingly 
desperate attempts to provoke a big final battle  
in fact they presented the raf with ever 
larger and easier targets of bombers  
if you look for a reason it is in intelligence 
both sides had inaccurate estimates of the  
other strength the germans had underestimated 
the raf strength at the start of the battle  
and they never had an idea of the true level of 
the raf strength they were unaware of how bad  
things were for the british they were seeing 
their own strength destroyed with no effect  
had the germans known the true position they 
would surely have persevered with attacks on   the raf bases with who knows what effect 
on the course of the history of the world
the change of targeting by the germans initially 
caught britain's air defense system off balance  
and brought sorrowful destruction on september 7th 
only 92 anti-aircraft guns defended the capital  
even though their number was rapidly 
increased those barrages were mostly useless  
only driving attackers to higher altitudes 
from where the same weight of bombs fell
[Music] but as the raids continued the raf reorganized 
and found that in the new mass daylight raids  
the luftwaffe was offering easy targets and 
the balance of losses swung back heavily toward  
the british gradually eroding the luftwaffe's 
strength and confidence the logical thing for  
hitler to do the sensible thing if you like was 
to stick with their plan to continue the strategy  
that was slowly degrading the raf's capability 
destroying british bases destroying british planes
the battle of britain was a war of numbers 
each day the luftwaffe and the raf claimed  
to have won the day each exaggerated their 
own victories and minimized their losses  
the ability of each side to tell fact from 
fiction to know what was really happening  
was a crucial factor in determining the 
outcome of the battle the failure of nerve  
the decision to end attacks directly against the 
opposing air force was a turning point of the war
[Music]   the battle of britain exists 
in myth as well as in history  
but it's no myth that the future of freedom 
from the whole dark science of nazi tyranny  
lay in the hands of little more than 
two and a half thousand young men
history likes to assign clear dates to the start 
and end of events in fact the real happenings tend  
to be far more blurred throughout early september 
the mass daylight attacks on london continued with  
heavy german losses hitler realized the raf 
could not be defeated the invasion of britain  
could not happen the raids on london gradually 
turn from daylight to night the object no longer  
the destruction of the raf but of london the big 
plan the strategy for defeating britain different
[Music] while the big picture was that 
germany had suffered a major defeat   had failed to take victory on offer this 
might not seem the case for the citizens of  
london the blitz was yet another test of the 
theory that air power alone could win a war  
win by breaking the will to resist of a population 
by inflicting terror and exhaustion [Music]  
once again the most carefully argued of peacetime 
theories as to how the next war would be won  
was put to the test of actual war and 
the course of events was to confound the   best thought out plans [Music] in the first 
phase of the blitz bombers came every night  
indiscriminate vaguely aimed attacks 
were made on the docks on the east end  
after the heavy losses of the battle of britain 
the blitz was a happy time for the luftwaffe  
with german losses of only one percent 
of sorties flown the british defenses for  
all the roar of anti-aircraft artillery and 
the ranks of barrage balloons were impotent  
the guns were told to fire indiscriminately 
for the benefit of civilian morale [Music]  
indeed it is legendary how the 
british people showed that bombing   does not break the will to resist 
and in many cases stiffened resolve  
the british civilians climbed over the rubble 
to carry on their lives in defiance of hitler
looking back from a world where war and airstrikes 
are reported as breaking news where the perception  
of a war is as important as the actual strikes 
it is perhaps hard for us to see the blitz as  
a media event as news information the same way 
as we see wars fought over 50 years later thanks  
to the anderson shelter we're quite safe i think 
he dropped a couple of bombs on us and it shook   anderson's shoulder like very ill but 
when i had the four boys talk to me i was  
quite contented the blitz was the german 
attempt to make the british people reject the  
belligerent defiance of churchill to weary 
them of war and prepared to accept peace  
on any terms the blitz was presented 
by the british in ways that outraged
images of business as usual of prime minister of 
king and queen with the victims of this terrorism  
were used to present the leadership as 
all endless together with the people  
the pictures of ordinary innocent civilians 
made homeless turned into refugees in their own  
country was used in a drip feed of propaganda 
to turn u.s public opinion against the nazis  
the truth of the blitz as with all truth is 
more complex than the fiction in some places  
civilians did flee the cities of britain in 
panic some people did loot from bomb wreckage  
churchill was not always greeted with cheers the 
british communist party tried to stir agitation  
that workers were being allowed to 
die through lack of air raid shelters
we live in a world where politicians are 
too often led by public opinion polls  
polls are not new it's a simple fact that 
in secret gallup polls taken by the british  
government throughout the blitz 80 percent of the 
population believed in ultimate british victory  
with the battle of britain of failure and his main 
enemies still defiant though bloodied what now was  
hitler's plan what now could be his strategy 
for victory on october 12th hitler canceled  
operation sea lion the invasion of britain and 
a new german strategy was unfolded rather than  
deliver a knockout blow hitler now chose to 
pound around at the edges to wear britain out  
pressure on britain would be increased by attacks 
on evermore fronts stretching both britain's  
resources and the will to continue the incessant 
pressure of the blitz would stretch the nerves  
diplomacy will be used to add to britain's enemies 
inducing more and more countries by either threat  
or the offer of the spoils of victory to come 
over to the axis in the high summer of 1941  
following a desperate plea for help by mussolini 
the disastrous italian war effort is rescued as  
german forces move south shoring up their fascist 
ally and securing the southern flank of the axis  
in affecting the rescue of the italians the 
forces of nazism march to ever greater victories  
bringing ever larger territories under their 
dominion in just weeks the lightning successes  
of the blitzkrieg of 1940 are matched as 
german forces sweep southwards bringing  
an avalanche of war to the balkans yugoslavia 
and greece collapse within days in yugoslavia  
the german attack reopens ancient enmities and 
wounds yugoslav starts to attack yugoslav the  
greek defense aided by british troops is valiant 
but nevertheless ends in a mediterranean dunkirk  
as 50 000 troops are evacuated from the greek 
mainland many escape to the greek island of crete  
but the island proves no refuge as the germans 
pursue their enemy and fill the skies above the  
wind dark sea with parachutes as german airborne 
assault brings savage fighting ending in further  
defeat and evacuation america slowly realizes 
that it cannot stand aloof from a war that is  
rapidly and clearly becoming not just a war like 
any other but a struggle for freedom for values  
central to the american way of life the american 
congress brings lend lease into law the united  
states will now supply britain with whatever is 
needed to ensure the survival of freedom in europe  
in north africa irwin rommel has 
begun to earn a place in history   his inspired generalship results in the 
reversal of british advances rommel even  
captures his opposite number as a prisoner of war 
the german high command think rommel has gone mad
germany has its attention elsewhere 
as the greatest military operation in   world history rolls forward this is operation 
barbarossa the invasion of the soviet union  
in the nazis fictional mythology and theory 
of history an insane worldview of past present  
and future combined the destruction of 
the soviet system is armageddon the final  
battle the struggle of good and evil a 
fight that will effectively end history
the soviet forces though large were poorly 
trained poorly equipped and poorly led armies  
can only reflect the strengths and weaknesses 
of the society from which they're drawn   the soviet command had been savagely targeted 
by stalin's purges a climate of fear pervaded  
the russian army fear to show initiative 
feared to show independence of thought  
the initial successes of barbarossa had led hitler 
to already plan triumphal victory celebrations  
with armies marching through the streets of moscow 
in a commemoration of the ultimate victory of  
nazism in that late summer of 1941 the future of 
world civilization stood poised in the balance  
the fighting that was in the coming 
months to take place in russia   in the desert and on the oceans that 
would take place on as yet unimagined  
battlefields would begin the long march 
to defeat for the forces of darkness
the summer countryside of russia 
was ideal for armored warfare   a war of vast spaces limitless horizons 
with no natural obstacle to aid a defender
operation barbarossa had 
consisted of three great thrusts   massive armored attacks into the 
expanse of the russian heartland
in the first month of barbarossa 
hundreds of thousands of prisoners   of war were taken by the nazis 
as the three-pronged attack began
in the north of russia the main thrust of 
advance came around the city of leningrad   modern-day saint petersburg the capital 
of czarist russia leningrad was a city  
of two and a half million and was ordered by 
stalin to resist to the end to never surrender
the germans surrounded leningrad with 
a tight strangling ligature of siege
[Music] the necessity of war can make 
desperate alliances possible  
in 1939 the soviet union had cynically used its 
size to bully and invade its neighbor finland  
when germany had attacked the ussr the 
finns knew that in alliance with germany  
lay their only chance to avenge that 
defeat and regain their lost lands
in the very far north finnish armies 
added a fourth dimension to barbarossa   attacking towards leningrad and completing 
the axis grip encircling the city
the soviet union realized that barbarossa 
was not a war that would be resolved with   some minor reduction of borders not a war that 
could be negotiated or compromised into peace  
for both communism and nazism barbarossa 
was a fight of mutual destruction  
in the end only one system would 
or indeed could remain [Music]  
stalin called on the soviet people to fight what 
he called a great patriotic war stalin ruthlessly  
ordered a policy of scorched earth before the 
advancing germans the retreating russians were to  
demolish the very fabric of the country destroying 
buildings burning crops cities and towns
destroying or taking away anything that 
would be of the remotest value to the invader  
whole factories and industries which were 
necessary to the russian war effort were   dismantled piece by piece and moved across the 
immense distance of the soviet union to the  
east of moscow from europe into asia beyond 
the ural mountains to the depths of siberia
in the vast swirling maelstrom that was barbarossa 
where lines of advance vaulted across the maps of  
generals where units lay at the end of tenuous 
some distant lines of supply there were spaces  
around and behind the germans into these 
spaces the partisan armies of russia formed  
usually led by fanatical communists these 
forces conducted a campaign of sabotage  
ambush and assassination what later 
would be called guerrilla war [Music]  
stalin was prepared to dismantle the 
mental landscape of the communist state   and the bolshevik revolution the atheism 
of communism was abandoned and the church  
encouraged to present the war as a holy 
war a fight for the god of the russians  
once the damaging influence of communism upon 
the soviet war machine was abandoned old czarist  
military traditions were revived traditions 
that built martial spirit and esprit de corps
in the south of russia the german advance pushed 
on deep into the black soil region of the ukraine  
this was an attack upon 
both the agricultural wealth   and the southern industrial cities of the 
soviet union toward cities such as stalingrad  
after just one month of fighting in the east 
the germans were already planning a triumphal  
victory procession through the streets of moscow 
to take place in late august hitler had stated  
that germany's aim in the east should be firstly 
to rule secondly to administer thirdly to exploit
hitler believed his enemies beneath contempt 
as both communists and as slavic peoples  
hitler abandoned the rules and conventions of war 
for barbarossa the german army was given orders  
to shoot dad anyone in the east who opposed them 
moscow and leningrad were to be systematically  
raised wiped from the map the inhabitants 
annihilated or driven out by starvation  
the germans were to institute a giant program 
of what would in later years come to be called   ethnic cleansing the nazi general plan east 
envisaged vast movements of population with  
german peoples moving into territories freed 
by the removal of the existing inhabitants  
in the wake of the advancing german armies 
came the first of the einsteins groupon   special squads of the ss dedicated to the 
calculated methodical elimination of jews
[Music]   foreign [Music]  
as it became clear that barbarossa was a total 
war a war in which german victory would bring  
total destruction of not just communism but the 
russian people the red army stiffened its resolve  
and will to resist reorganized and became 
more competent in resisting german attacks
the industrial base that the soviet 
union had managed to move to the east   enabled the material losses of the 
first few months to be replaced
the german attacks may have been on a scale 
never before seen but in fact the cold hard  
light of hindsight shows that the germans had 
not in fact prepared enough their reserves of  
supplies and fresh troops were not enough to 
exploit the massive successes and advances  
massive spaces created behind the armies   still left room for soviet partisans to 
sabotage and disrupt the german supply lines
as the year progressed as 
september passed to october   rains which turned roads to mud further 
hampered and slowed the nazi advance
in spite of this increasing resistance 
hitler still chose to gamble with the thin  
and shallow reserves of german strength he ordered 
that the war should be brought to an end in 1941.  
in october he ordered that the final attack 
should be made upon the soviet capital moscow  
a thrust straight to the heart of soviet power
[Music]   in the western desert of north africa battles were   fought between the africa 
corps and the british army
the germans under rommel had pushed the british 
back and laid siege to the port of to brooke  
the battle for tobruk was an essential one for 
rummel to win the german plan was to push forward  
to attack and take egypt and the suez canal from 
that base to threaten british middle eastern oil  
and perhaps even to push into british india to 
brooke was literally a thorn in rommel's side  
enabling the british to strike at the rear of 
any africa core advance churchill thought the  
western desert a crucial theater of war at that 
time it was the only battlefield in which the  
british army could directly engage the german army 
for a britain which was having just to take it  
absorb all the bombs that the luftwaffe could 
drop and endure the toll of shipping attacks  
in the north atlantic with all the attendant 
sacrifice and hardship the war in the desert  
was the only campaign where the british did not 
have to wait and see what the enemy would do
churchill bombarded the commanders of his force in 
the middle east with instructions and suggestions  
commanders were given only a short 
time in which to prove themselves   in the spring of 1941 general wavel had 
been dismissed for failure in the offensive  
which had been defeated by rommel's genius for 
improvisation churchill was persuaded by wavel's  
successor orkenlack to throw precious resources 
at the army in egypt now named the eighth army  
in an offensive codename crusader 
the eighth army carefully planned   an attack on the germans in november 
1941 rommel anticipated and preempted  
the move mounting a renewed assault 
of his own upon the port of to brook
rommel was an innovating inspired 
general who could react quickly   he turned his attack around and smashed 
back the eighth army time and time again  
in the desert war both sides would be limited from 
exploiting their successes by problems of supply
[Music]   rommel could not pursue the british 
and once more the two armies fell  
back to regather their strength the 
germans returned to the siege of tabruk  
the british under yet another new 
general considered their plan of action  
with german involvement in the mediterranean 
the german supply lines were becoming stronger  
soon rommel would be capable of a push that would 
place britain's future in the war in jeopardy
[Music] across the atlantic the united states was slowly 
but surely being drawn onto the center stage of  
the action british prime minister churchill knew 
that the defeat of nazi germany would not come  
without the direct involvement of the united 
states we shall give every possible assistance  
to britain and to all who with britain are 
resisting hitlerism or its equivalent [Music]  
all british diplomacy was directed in a 
campaign of persuasion and propaganda at   the american government and public throughout the 
war in a series of agreements america was drawn  
closer to the war in august 1941 at the placentia 
bay conference in canada churchill and roosevelt  
agreed and signed what came to be known as the 
atlantic charter the charter was an agreement  
a statement of shared beliefs that was a list of 
war aims and a blueprint for the post-war peace  
neither britain nor america sought conquest of 
territory no border was to change no territory  
altered without consent of the population all 
peoples have the right of self-government restored  
after the war all states would have the 
right to economic resources for prosperity  
all countries were to 
collaborate for international   after the destruction of nazi tyranny would 
be the establishment of a lasting peace  
there was to be freedom of the sea all 
nations were to abandon force despite the  
shared aspirations of the atlantic charter america 
was still legally a neutral country with many of  
its citizens wanting their country to stay firmly 
out of any foreign war yet the legally neutral us  
was already fighting an unofficial war against 
the german navy the kriegs marine and its force of  
u-boats in the atlantic the battle of the atlantic 
was not a naval battle in the conventional stance  
some climatic struggle an engagement where 
all forces met together and a war could be won  
in a day or in an hour rather the battle of the 
atlantic has been famously described as trench  
warfare at sea reach sides sought to destroy the 
other a fight of numbers a fight only to kill
it was a war that was simple to understand   sink british ships faster than british 
shipyards could build replacements  
build replacement u-boats faster than the 
british navy could destroy their attackers  
the war would be won a simple economic equation 
would give a target that would be expressed in  
mathematics in numbers and tons of ships that 
must be sent to the bottom the autumn of 1941  
was called the happy time for the german 
navy it was a time when victory seemed easy  
once france had fallen and the whole atlantic 
coast of europe stood free for ax's use when the  
isolationist sentiment of the united states was 
strong the simple target was to sink between 600  
and 750 000 tons of british bound shipping per 
month this would bring nazi victory in a year  
the early part of the war was a time of missed 
opportunities but by the autumn of 1941 the  
number of boats had risen and tactics devised 
which were to seriously threaten atlantic trade
in 1941 for all submarines for all   ships to find an enemy at sea in the vast 
expanse of the ocean was a difficult task
radars were primitive not 
yet perfected for use at sea  
sonar was a short-range weapon only useful for a 
surface ship attacking a close underwater target
a u-boat finding a target was dependent on visual 
sightings limited to the distance of the horizon  
from the low angle of a submarine tower 
the u-boat officer was worse off than   the lookout of a sailing ship atop a tall mast
the convoy system that grouped merchant vessels 
together under the protection of warships was  
an old tactic that dated from the days of sailing 
navies it had defeated the u-boat in world war one  
it not only meant that the attacker would have 
to fight warships the convoy system meant that  
targets were harder to find a convoy of 30 
ships closely grouped together was harder to  
find than 30 individual ships strung out across 
the shipping lanes of the ocean the united states  
navy escorted convoys halfway effectively doubling 
the number of ships available to deter the enemy
the kriegsmarine of world war ii had new 
tactics the doctrine of the wolf pack
the bold u-boat commander was 
not intimidated by the convoy   and when attacking in a wolf pack could still 
inflict heavy losses with large numbers of u-boats  
the submarines could be spread in the line across 
the possible course of a convoy of merchantmen  
when a sighting was made high-frequency radio 
messages would transmit the convoy's position  
to a shore base that would in turn broadcast a 
guidance signal that would lead all submarines  
to attack the target it was as if a giant 
drift net was laid across the ocean [Music]
a u-boat making first contact would silently 
discreetly shadow the merchant ships sending  
the signals to gather the other members 
of the wolf pack the attack would be made   at night the commanders of u-boats needed courage 
to stealthily approach the convoy in the darkness  
trying to pass through the screen of escorts 
closing to perhaps within 600 meters before firing
[Music] for the merchant seamen the battle of the 
atlantic was a slow and tense torture the  
days spent scanning the sea for the periscope 
trail that might reveal an unseen enemy at night  
waiting for almost inevitable explosions 
each ship dying a particular death  
oil tankers would explode in white pillars of 
flame cargoes of heavy iron machinery would  
drag ship and crew to the depths in minutes in the 
morning a convoy would trail a wake of the debris  
burning oil bodies stranded sailors 
awaiting rescue destroyed ships
against the submarine on the surface at night 
there was little that an escort of warships could   do on the surface most u-boats were fast enough to 
get away from a pursuer sonar the underwater radar  
in its infancy could not find a surfaced u-boat 
the u-boat commander needed courage and luck  
but fortune favored the bold who could make rich 
pickings the balance of tactical strength lay  
with the germans even though convoy ships were 
more secure than lone sailings the convoys were  
not enough defense the ideas and weaponry not 
sufficiently evolved to present any real threat  
in 1941 3.6 million tons of shipping was 
sunk an average of 250 000 tons per month
the north atlantic was a 
hard unforgiving environment   with savage weather and bitter storms 
water in which men survived for minutes  
tempests which battered and exhausted men on 
both sides men in a state of constant alert
the submarine hull designed for underwater 
made a rolling unstable platform on the surface  
u-boat officers did not look out across the 
sea rather they looked up from the surface  
long hours were spent drenched by freezing 
smashing waves the danger lay when escorts found  
a u-boat on the surface or locked on with sonar 
in a surface duel of gunfire the u-boat would  
lose if submerged and targeted by sonar the u-boat 
crew had to endure the terror of depth charging  
when crews would stand in complete 
silence listening to the sonar beam   pinging their hull hearing the swish of 
propellers the very skin of sailors and  
the hull of the boat as one the slightest 
knock to either causing a paroxysm of fear
the explosions would convulse the 
boats causing instruments to shatter   electrics to fail and seals explode with leaks 
of air and seawater attacks could last for a day
in the mythology of world war ii the submarine the 
u-boat the undersea is associated with the nazis  
yet in fact they were slow to realize 
the value of this arm of their navy   the submarine was not popular with sailors 
in any navy admirals brought up on surface  
action were reluctant to appreciate 
the strength of underwater forces
fiction and drama the mythology 
of world war ii have given us a   false impression a fabled account of 
how submarine operations were fought
the submarine of world war 
ii is better described as   a torpedo boat with the ability to hide underwater
the submarine as a capital warship able to 
operate independently submerged for many months  
with his highest speed as surface 
ships with his highest speed above   as below the surface able 
to operate at extreme depths  
with weapons capable of striking from extreme 
ranges was in 1941 a weapon of the future
although the u-boats were enjoying successes 
they had their great weaknesses which were to  
be exploited the world war ii u-boat came to the 
surface to attack was slow when underwater could  
only travel submerged for a short time and was 
forced to regularly surface to recharge batteries  
when surfaced its light 
armament made it an easy target  
when a wolf pack was summoned to gather around 
a convoy their voyages into position had to  
be made at high speed on the surface 
otherwise a convoy could not be caught
a major weakness of the u-boat which would be 
exploited was its vulnerability to air attack  
the british and the americans realized 
the value of air protection for convoys
[Music]   in 1941 the british occupied iceland to extend 
the range of air patrols to the mid-atlantic  
special radars were developed 
which could be mounted on aircraft   which coupled to powerful searchlights meant that 
the submarine was not safe on the surface at night  
the use of air power made the coordination 
of wolf pack attacks far more difficult the  
u-boats frequent periods on the surface became a 
hell of tension times of constant restless alerts  
with sudden attack panics and emergency dives
[Music]   a key weapon in the battle of the atlantic was 
the breaking of german codes time and time again  
in the history of war this most secret part of 
britain's armory would play a crucial role it  
was in the battle of the atlantic that the first 
breakthrough in the code breakers war was made  
british sailors had courageously boarded sinking 
u-boats fought with the crews and captured signals  
equipment and code books materials that given 
the first clues in the secret war by reading the  
messages sent to the u-boat packs convoys could 
be rerouted and aircraft dispatched to attack
many brave men were to lose their 
lives in the atlantic in 1941   merchant seamen left adrift as the 
convoy could not stop to rescue survivors
the crews of u-boats had the highest 
rate of loss of any serving in the war
[Music]   the greatest defense that the british had 
against the u-boat assault was simply to  
reverse the weakness to reverse the vulnerability 
factored into the grim mathematics of the campaign  
was britain's pre-war need to import more than 50 
million tons of goods each year from the rare and  
exotic materials of war to the everyday staple 
foods of life by 1941 the british people had  
cut this figure by more than half to only 23 
million tons for ordinary people this meant  
a strict and severe regime of food rationing 
with many favorite foods disappearing altogether  
the british people became a nation of small 
peasant farmers livestock were to be found   in the backyards of cities and towns every tiny 
scrap of land was turned into a vegetable patch  
the agricultural industry began to exploit and 
ring every gram of produce from the most marginal  
areas of land new areas came under the plow the 
powers of the state to conscript and direct labor  
created a land army where workers 
were directed to work on the farms  
the image of grim cues of shortage and the 
persistent folk memory of the hardships of  
rationing disguise a historic scientific fact 
that the population of britain was in fact  
never so properly fed with 
the correct dietary balance
the rationing extended to 
almost every area of life   private motoring practically disappeared 
as it became impossible to fuel a car  
some automobiles were converted to gas with a 
ballooning comedy gas bag swaying atop the roof
fashions changed to reflect 
wartime shortages of fabric
if britain was turned into a nation of small 
farmers it was also turned into a nation of   petty criminals the strictness of state control 
led inevitably to a black market when state  
regulations seem so absolute and far-reaching 
the pressure amongst even the most law-abiding  
to obtain the smallest luxuries by whatever means 
possible with no questions asked was irresistible
[Music] the british people were told time and 
time again what to do and how to do it in a  
barrage of propaganda and public information 
that permeated every aspect of daily life  
in a war for freedom british subjects 
became controlled less free than ever before
another factor in the algebra of the submarine war 
was the rate at which ships could replace those  
sunk once again war provided the stimulus for 
innovation and the shipbuilding industry responded  
by changing design and construction to build more 
ships more quickly the product of this innovation  
came to be known as the liberty ship these were 
mass-produced ships built by methods more akin to  
the auto assembly line the design was british but 
modified into practicality by american builders  
more than two and a half thousand were built 
sometimes in phenomenally short periods   on one occasion as short a period is four days 
and 15 hours from laying of keel to launch
the cost and time saving methods of construction 
and the use of workers unused to ship folding  
meant that the quality of the ships was sometimes 
doubtful some could just fall apart but in their  
vast numbers they piled the odds against the 
axis in november 1941 the german army was  
ordered to win the war to finish off the russians 
by capturing the russian capital moscow this was a  
gamble the original planners of barbarossa had not 
expected such success to come so soon the capture  
of moscow needed the last desperate effort by 
german soldiers who had already expended so much  
what hitler was to call the final effort 
of willpower was a push by troops at the  
very end of their energy by the end of november 
amidst the snows and mud of the russian winter  
the german armies were within 30 kilometers of 
moscow the city had been evacuated and the kremlin  
prepared for demolition as a preferred 
fate for the historical heart of russia  
early in december the germans had to end 
the attack exhausted they hoped for a pause  
before renewed fighting in the spring instead on 
december 5th the soviet army launched a ferocious  
counter-attack the german army unequipped 
to fight in winter suffered terrible losses  
in the deepest cold the weakness rather than 
the strength of a dictatorship was revealed  
the weakness of a leadership where war was 
directed by a single will and a single ego  
hitler refused to give ground 
refused to order retreat   that could save his forward units 
from encirclement and defeat
in the end the germans suffered heavy casualties 
and were pushed back 300 kilometers from moscow  
barbarossa ended in the snow before moscow there 
was still much fighting and dying to be done  
but the greatest and most telling death in 
barbarossa was the myth of german invincibility  
an army used to carrying all before it had been 
defeated 980 000 men killed wounded or captured  
nearly a third of those who 
started the invasion had been lost
[Music] the russian soldiers who so 
stunned the germans with surprise attacks   were fresh from russia's far east a reflection 
of the truth that the war was a global war  
russia had been able to move these troops 
across asia because there was no longer a   threat from the empire of japan whose gaze 
looked another way it was decisions made  
on the other side of the globe that enabled the 
soviet leadership to deploy the siberian forces  
against the nazi armies decisions made 
in tokyo capital of the empire of japan
japan was allied to the fascists of germany 
and italy but it would be a mistake to say  
that the three major members of the axis shared a 
dominant ideology japan shared a theory of racial  
superiority shared a militarism which saw armed 
force as a virtue however the prime japanese  
policy aim was to supplant the european powers as 
the dominant political and economic forces in asia  
had germany been the dominant power in the pacific   rather than britain and america the relationships 
of alliance would have been reversed japan had  
long harbored ambitions against soviet territory 
in the far east japan looked everywhere in the  
far east with envious eyes upon the resources 
of neighboring states looking to expand to the  
north through its puppet state of manchuria 
and to the south and east into the pacific  
by late 1941 japan's envy and ambition was 
directed only to the south japan in 1941  
had been at war for longer than any other of the 
major powers fighting a war of conquest in china  
japan's motivation in this expansion was resources 
in a circular logic it fought wars to provide the  
materials to power its armed forces to fight more 
wars oil aluminum tin rubber were all materials  
which japan could not produce japan was dependent 
on imports of food to feed its population  
the richest areas of southeast asia the 
vast rubber plantations of british malaya  
the oil of indonesia the vast rice fields of 
french vietnam were all controlled by europeans  
japan was a militaristic state dominated 
by the needs of the armed forces   the emperor hirohito believed a god by the 
japanese people reigned but did not actually rule  
power lay with a government dominated by generals   when in july japan took advantage of the fall of 
france to seize the french colony of indochina  
the united states broke all relations with 
the empire japan invited indochina to be a  
member of the greater co-prosperity sphere an 
organization whose words spoke of independence  
for the indigenous peoples of asia but in 
action was just a mechanism for draining  
the resources of the member states redirecting 
them with ever greater ruthlessness towards japan
the united states demanded that 
before trade could be restored   japan must both withdraw from indochina 
and from the long war against china herself  
america was preparing for war recalling 
early in the year the preeminent soldier  
douglas macarthur took command in the 
pacific characteristically macarthur had  
taken a positive stance with a plan to defend 
the philippines with strong and modern forces
to the japanese this american policy only 
reinforced a paranoid sense of persecution  
reinforcing those who argued war was essential 
when in october 1941 heide kaito joe an aggressive  
general became prime minister the path for japan 
was set to war and secret preparations were begun  
the japanese knew that to fight a war 
of expansion in the pacific they had to   neutralize the american navy in the pacific the 
american navy was then the largest in the world  
while negotiating peace the base of pearl harbor 
in hawaii was targeted for surprise assault  
the japanese fleet approached in complete 
secrecy hiding behind a weather front as  
it crossed the ocean the fleet of 
aircraft carriers came by a distant   indirect route circling far around the north of 
hawaii from this least likely direction of attack
on december 11 1941 at 6 am the japanese 
planes appeared in the skies of hawaii  
it was a sunday morning surprise was complete
at pearl harbor that day 70 warships lay 
at anchor including eight battleships  
torpedo and dive bombers attacked the 
lines of ships in the airfields then  
high-level bombers made further results in 
an attack that lasted a bare two hours six  
battleships were stunk and two damaged 
numerous smaller ships also sunk and damaged
more than 160 aircraft were destroyed 2403 servicemen and civilians were killed and 
1178 wounded the japanese losses were a mere 29  
aircraft in a moment of caution the japanese 
fearing a counter-attack failed to complete the  
action with a series of attacks upon the harbors 
dockyard the repair and refueling facilities  
mundane unglamorous targets which have as 
great significance as any capital warship  
significantly as dramatic as the burning 
battleships appeared the battleship was  
the naval weapon of the past japan had 
used aircraft carriers to attack its enemy  
but had failed to find and destroy us aircraft 
carriers that had been at sea that day on exercise  
to say that the attack found the americans 
completely unprepared and totally and completely  
ignorant of a japanese threat is wrong america was 
expecting japanese attacks but it was thought this  
first strike would be against the american forces 
in the philippines rather than at pearl harbor  
if the attack were made in hawaii it would be 
directed from the nearest japanese territory  
to the southwest of the islands pearl harbor 
was on full alert to protect against sabotage  
us planes were grouped together to guard against 
attack by saboteur a move which made it easy for  
japanese planes to make their attacks hawaii 
was protected by radar the attacking waves of  
japanese aircraft were detected the surprise lay 
in that america was not looking for the attack
as tactics as a demonstration of 
the use of stealth and concealment   using the tools of war pearl harbor is 
a textbook example of stunning victory  
as strategy though the japanese 
action was a catastrophic move   a move which caused the ruin of every scheme 
device and stratagem of their country the attack  
on that sunday morning condemned the 
japanese forces to eventual destruction
the japanese were attempting a victory to match 
that of trafalgar a defeat that meant the american  
navy would be swept from the sea to allow the 
japanese to strike where they wished it well
once stirred the strengths of america the 
ability for organization for efficiency the  
positive optimism and self-belief the sheer volume 
of wealth and industry made america a terrible foe  
pearl harbor was an event that at a 
stroke galvanized the american nation  
resolving all difference quelling all 
isolationist sentiment december 7th 1941
a date which will live in infamy united states 
of america was suddenly and deliberately attacked  
by naval and air forces of the empire of japan the 
japanese planned to take advantage of the defeat  
by initiating a massive plan of invasion and 
conquest across southeast asia and the pacific  
their strength would be increased as a result 
and deter the usa from attacking the empire  
the reasoning the wishful thinking of the 
japanese planners was that the us would accept  
the new state of affairs except japan as the new 
dominant power and compromise of peace the harder  
headed within the japanese armed forces knew in 
their hearts and minds that pearl harbor was not  
a war winning victory simply a triumph 
that had bought time in which to gamble  
that through a desperate effort the 
us could be defeated privately though  
secretly admiral yamamoto the architect of 
pearl harbor predicted i can run wild for  
the first six months or a year i have utterly 
no confidence for the second and third years  
anyone who has seen the oil fields of texas 
and the factories of detroit knows this
six months by the end of which victory 
must be won or defeat was inevitable  
victory would be impossible in a long war that 
very lack of the raw materials and industrial  
strength that motivated their ambitions would be 
their downfall in a contest with the titanic power  
of america on december 7th germany 
and italy declared war on america  
winston churchill said he slept 
easily for the first time in the war   with the attack upon the us fleet battles 
encircled the globe to the people of america  
this was the beginning of the war for the forces 
of fascism the beginning of the end [Music]
next time on world war ii the complete history  
the japanese war effort rolls out across the 
pacific in the precious months bought by the  
attack on pearl harbor country after country 
are swamped by a tidal wave of japanese might  
thousands of troops surrender as singapore falls 
in the greatest defeat the british empire has  
ever known the defeat a catastrophe a 
textbook example of military disaster
douglas macarthur promises to return as u s   forces are driven from the philippines with 
the capture of thousands of u.s soldiers

prove the deadly enemy of the mighty battleship as  
two british warships are sunk [Music] in russia 
the german forces endure the severest of winters  
and thousands of poorly equipped soldiers die of 
cold in the spring the german offensive is renewed  
with attacks into the south towards the industrial

in the skies of britain and germany 
the war becomes an open conflict of  
civilizations as each side targets air

the enemies of the axis come together to 
issue the united nations declaration [Music]  
after a few months of conquest and 
triumph the worst predictions of saner   japanese minds begin to come true american 
bombers appear in the skies above tokyo
in two titanic naval battles in the pacific the 
tide begins to turn against japan at the battle  
of the coral sea a stalemate at the battle 
of midway american carrier aircraft tear the  
heart from the japanese imperial navy and the long 
slow end game of japan's defeat is already begun
[Music] january 1st 1942 saw the 
united nations declaration  
this was a grand alliance between china the 
united kingdom the united states and the ussr  
this was the first formal alliance 
made by the united states since 1778  
all signatories agreed to use all their strength 
and resources against the axis to cooperate with  
the others to fight until the defeat of the 
axis and not to make a separate peace [Music]  
the destruction of pearl harbor was simply the 
first element of a much greater japanese strategy  
of invasion and expansion an unstoppable tsunami 
of conquest swept across the eastern pacific  
into southeast asia leaping across land and sea 
skipping across the archipelagos from island  
to ireland stepping stones to victory the u.s 
islands of the philippines were taken by surprise  
only a few days following the attack on pearl 
harbor inexplicably once more us aircraft  
were caught unawares on the ground lined up in 
neat rows making the task of the japanese easy  
with naval superiority japanese marines made 
easy landings in both the north and south of  
the islands catching the us forces in 
the grip of a pincer movement quickly  
90 000 japanese troops were 
in place to attack just 25 000   american defenders defenders who the united 
states could do little to reinforce or aid
the british colony of malaya was invaded from 
the north through the territory of japan's ally  
thailand the japanese swiftly captured airfields 
in northern malaya and then began a quick advance  
down the peninsula the japanese had gained air 
and sea supremacy in the skies and seas off malaya  
on december 10th two british battleships 
the prince of wales and the repulse  
the only major naval forces britain could 
muster had been caught in daylight off   the eastern malaya coast by japanese 
bombers based in thailand and vietnam  
time and time again in world war 
ii the battleship was shown to be   the capital warship of the past redundant too 
vulnerable to air attack to survive [Music]
[Music]  
the two battleships were destroyed by a 
swarm of aircraft in just two hours [Music]
hello [Music]
[Music] so the japanese wanted malaya for 
its rich economic reserves the tin mines  
and the vast rubber plantations which 
were needed for japan's war effort
the japanese wanted to capture the giant 
british naval base on the southern tip of   the malay peninsula on the island of singapore 
denying these facilities to their enemies adding  
them as a base for further japanese aggression 
the japanese advanced rapidly down the peninsula  
capturing province after province the british 
colony of hong kong was surrounded and besieged  
once again the japanese air force had 
destroyed the opposition swiftly at the   start of the campaign and then subjected 
the 8 000 defenders to constant bombing  
40 000 japanese troops brought the british under 
constant pressure in the expanse of the pacific  
conflict came to the distant archipelagos of tiny 
islands lying astride the strategic roots of war  
on december 10th the island of guam fell to 
japanese invasion it and other small islands  
were intended to be fortresses in a ring of 
defenses around japan's new empire on the  
same day wake island held by just 400 marines 
and 1 000 construction workers was attacked by  
japanese warships and taken 12 days later still 
the wave of expansion went on on december 15th  
japanese armies had invaded the british colony of 
burma the japanese were attempting to cut supply  
lines to their nationalist chinese enemies and to 
use burma as a base for attacks on british india
in the very wildest of axes dreams japanese armies 
marching into india were then met by german armies  
which had swept eastwards from southern russia 
and north africa via arabia and iran the wave  
of japanese success revealed inherent tensions 
within the axis alliance it was an alliance of  
necessity rather than ideology hitler commented 
half in despair the japanese are occupying  
all the islands they will get australia the 
white race will disappear from these regions
japan did seek to drive the 
white colonial powers from asia   appealing over the heads of european imperial 
masters to the indigenous populations  
the army that attacked burma a state which had 
been independent of british rule within living  
memory contained thousands of japanese trained 
burmese nationalists fighting for their country's  
liberation the rate of japanese advance in 
those early days and weeks was astounding  
scarcely a day went by without some new 
attack begun or a new victory proclaimed  
on december 23 1941 japanese troops invaded borneo 
the objective in borneo the british controlled  
oil fields again a crucial resource of war on 
christmas day hong kong fell in a medieval move  
the japanese had cut the city's water supply 
the new year brought no respite on january 11th  
the dutch east indies modern day indonesia 
was attacked by japanese paratroopers again  
the goal was oil reserves on january 12 the 
capital of malaya kuala lumpur surrendered
in the philippines us general douglas macarthur 
led a dogged defense of the bataan peninsula  
into which the u.s forces are 
gradually pinned by the japanese   the morale amongst the u.s forces is high but 
macarthur is told in secret that no relief  
column no rescue fleet can be sent bataan has 
less than a month starvation rations remaining  
throughout australia panic seized the population 
as the possibility of invasion once seeming so  
remote for so distant a country began to 
threaten on january 24th japan invaded  
australian-controlled new guinea they brought 
massive strength to bear and quickly overran the  
territory in malaya the fighting drew to a climax 
the japanese forces had cleared the peninsula  
and all british and empire troops had 
withdrawn to the fortress of singapore  
singapore was the mythology of the british 
empire built into actuality a trading city  
where europeans could amass fortunes quickly a 
center of maritime trade a conduit for wealth  
a huge naval base which harbored the ships of the 
navy that bound the empire together with iron that  
the british empire was a maritime empire one held 
together by a navy was the downfall of singapore  
the assumption was that the city would be 
attacked by the navy of another european country  
singapore had mighty defenses powerful 
guns all pointed to the south to the sea  
the japanese came from the north over land [Music]  
winston churchill saw the defense 
of singapore in dramatic terms   he signaled to the british commanders battle must 
be fought to the bitter end commander and senior  
officers should die with the troops the honor of 
the british empire is at stake despite sitting  
atop a massive arsenal of ammunition 130 000 did 
surrender the japanese had cut water supplies  
and subjected the city to constant air bombardment 
the lives of one million civilians were at risk  
general arthur percival led the greatest 
surrender in british military history  
fourteen thousand australians sixteen thousand 
british and thirty two thousand indian soldiers  
were marched into captivity japanese 
general yamashita achieved the victory  
with less than two 000 casualties it 
was the climax to a brilliant campaign
the japanese cloaked their invasion 
in the language of anti-imperialism   indeed this produced a reaction from the british 
expressly against churchill's wishes the british  
government under pressure from america offered 
india the same status within the british empire  
as australia or canada the offer was made 
conditional upon indian support for the war  
of the more than 32 000 indians who 
surrendered to the japanese at singapore   many were to join the indian national army led 
by indian revolutionaries the ina was to fight  
alongside the japanese army 
against the british empire [Music]  
the outbreak of war between america and japan 
brought deep and profound changes for the  
japanese american citizens of the united states 
for those of the second generation the nissai  
born and raised in the usa the war was to 
be a major test of the degree to which these  
americans were truly assimilated in march 1942 
more than 110 000 japanese americans living on  
the west coast of america were forced 
to move abandoning businesses and homes
on february 10 1942 the fear which had spread 
through australian society was shown to have a  
basis in reality not rumor a powerful 
aircraft carrier force arrived in the  
waters off northern australia and attacked the 
northern australian city in port of darwin once  
again surprise was complete and japanese losses 
limited to a single plane the devastating raid  
designed to disrupt any support that might have 
been given to resist the invasion of the dutch   east indies caused a general panic as military and 
civilians fled into the interior of the country
the east indies were the richest 
territories in the dutch colonial empire   a seventh of the income of the netherlands 
economy coming from this one province for  
japan the dutch colony was a prize of great value 
besides oil and coal the area produced rubber  
nickel and timber and was important agriculturally 
as a major source of rice sugar and tea  
the japanese saw the need to seize the 
islands quickly before any scorched earth   policy could be implemented and used maximum force 
possible invading it many places simultaneously  
as elsewhere in asia the japanese invaders 
were at first welcomed by the native population  
as liberators but soon they came to act as 
a replacement and harsher colonial regime
a combined dutch british 
american and australian fleet   attempted to intercept a japanese invading 
fleet but was completely destroyed
following pearl harbor president franklin 
roosevelt urged the us command to find some  
way to retaliate to strike back against the 
enemy the balance of power in the pacific  
immediately following pearl harbor meant that 
it would be difficult for an aircraft carrier   to safely approach japan to come within a 
range at which carrier aircraft could strike  
a daring and ingenious plan was formulated   16 army air force bombers were placed 
on board the aircraft carrier hornet  
launched more than 700 miles from tokyo the 
bombers had the range to reach japan they  
could not return to the carrier and had instead 
to fly on to airfields in china single bombers  
attacked naval dockyards and a force of 12 bombed 
tokyo the doolittle raid as it came to be known  
named after the army air force colonel who planned 
and trained the volunteer crews had an impact on  
the japanese far over and above the material 
effect of the attacks the raid on tokyo killed  
just 50 people and damaged 100 houses but no us 
planes were lost over japan some crew members  
who had to bail out over china were executed 
as war criminals by japanese occupying forces
us morale was raised by the news that something 
was being done the raid's greatest effect was  
upon the japanese high command and government the 
military government had boasted that japan would  
never be attacked the shock of bombs falling so 
close to the emperor caused panicked overreaction  
a surge of aggressive desire to bring the war 
to an end with victory the six months to run  
wild in the pacific that had been won by the 
attack on pearl harbor were nearing their end
the strategic bombing raid is a persistent 
element of the iconography of the war  
a mass raid by a multitude of planes filling 
the sky not the precision strike so called  
surgical strike by smart weapons simply 
the saturation of a target a factory a port  
a railway junction or perhaps just civilian 
housing in an act of terrorism attacks intended  
to intimidate to cow to cause panic to simply 
render homeless vast numbers of the enemy's people  
an attack aimed to undermine the enemy's 
government by showing it unable to protect  
its own an assault by thousands of 
bombs descending in clouds of death
before the war much had been predicted 
of air power as the means to win   wars quickly world war ii was to show this 
theory was not so easily put into practice
1942 saw the tactics of aerial bombardment develop 
in technology in extent and in ruthlessness
[Music] on march 29th the raf made an 
attack upon the german town of lupe  
a town where factories made 
the engines for u-boats
lubeck was also one of those small towns 
which adorned the continent of europe  
time capsules of architecture and of 
history of living culture it was destroyed  
bombed and burned flat its medieval buildings 
succumbing with terrifying ease to the raf  
nazi ideology was a theory of 
history that valued culture   in fury at the destruction of the german town the 
german leadership ordered revenge in an episode of  
war that was to border on black comedy the german 
command used the bay decker guide a tourist book  
describing the beautiful and historic sites 
of europe to select their targets a series of  
raids were made against targets of nothing more 
than cultural value the raids were not large not  
particularly devastating but the baydecker blitz 
as it came to be known was a further abandonment  
of the old-fashioned rules of war what one side 
could and could not perpetrate against the other  
after the fall of france there were very few ways 
in which britain could strike back in germany  
the bomber offensive was one of the 
few initiatives britain could take  
the lessons of the battle of britain and the blitz 
seemed to show daytime raids simply too costly to  
both crews and aircraft high losses meant that 
the attacks were switched to the night where  
darkness gave such protection to the attacker that 
losses were minimized the darkness also meant that  
attacks on a target as comparatively small as 
say an individual factory were impossible the  
raf's high command realized that the only 
alternative to abandoning the offensive  
was to target cities in mass attacks tactical 
necessity was turned into a strategic virtue  
the policy of city center raids was to become 
the center of controversy for years to come
in may 1942 the raf gathered together 
every element of its bomber strength  
combining frontline forces with all the 
reserves and training planes available   to launch one thousand aircraft against a 
single target cologne causing massive damage
the successes of the first 1000 plane attacks was 
not repeated as the concentration on one target  
meant that defense could similarly be concentrated   strategic bombing developed to the 
advantage of the allies and against the axis
the planes with which both sides began the war 
were in general medium-sized and twin-engined  
in the spring of 1942 the first four engine 
bombers much larger and more powerful aircraft  
appeared in the skies over germany the 
germany never developed a large bomber was  
a significant failure the british lancaster 
bomber and the american b-17 and b-24  
were capable of carrying heavy loads 
that were to devastate enemy cities
the prisoner of war is a constantly recurring 
figure in the mythology of world war ii the pow  
camp a fertile ground for the imagination of the 
professional storyteller with tales of endurance  
and sacrifice plus incredible impossible ingenuity 
the 150 000 british empire troops who surrendered  
at singapore were just a fraction of the 10 
million soldiers sailors and airmen who were  
to fall into the captivity of their enemy during 
the war the treatment of the prisoners of war was  
governed by the hague convention of 1907 which 
declared that men who had laid down their arms  
should be treated decently the geneva convention 
of 1929 laid down detailed rules for the treatment  
of prisoners under the convention the pow was 
to be removed from the battlefield as soon as  
possible if wounded treated fed and housed to the 
same standard as the captor country's own soldiers  
allowed to correspond with their families and 
famously entitled to refuse all information except  
name rank and number the conditions of pows were 
to be inspected by the international red cross  
if captured escaping a pow was to suffer no more 
than a month's solitary confinement the legendary  
30 days in the cooler the geneva convention 
was not acknowledged by either japan or the  
soviet union stalinist communism refused to 
accept that any soviet soldier would surrender  
historically the capture of an 
officer was a cause of dishonor   but by the time of world war ii the 
nature of war the huge scale of fighting  
the advent of air forces had caused a realization 
the capture might befall even the most [Music]
honorable no one foresaw the scale of the pow 
problem that was to arise in world war ii so utter  
was the collapse of poland and france that germany 
found itself with more than 2 million pows by 1940  
all sides in the war lost large numbers 
five million soviet soldiers were captured  
italians surrendered to 
the british in vast numbers   the fates which befell the prisoners of different 
armies varied widely the waffen ss the armed ss  
specialist units drawn from fanatical 
nazis rarely gave or asked for quarter  
in some areas of germany british and american 
aircrew were lynched in mobbed vengeance [Music]  
soviet prisoners falling into german hands 
were treated with what mounted to savagery  
nearly 80 percent died in captivity the germans 
claimed not to be bound by the geneva convention  
as the ussr had not signed russian 
officers were shot ordinary soldiers  
were left without food or shelter nazi 
racial theory held that anglo-saxons  
british and americans were aryan and deserving 
of respect slav soldiers were believed sub-human
in asia a different regime prevailed the japanese 
regarded surrender as irredeemable dishonor  
surrender of uninjured japanese was almost unknown 
and they despised the soldiers they took prisoner  
following singapore's fall as well as the captured 
dutch from the conquest of the east indies  
no attempt was made to provide humane treatment   a minimum of food and shelter was supplied 
in addition to intensive hard labor
in the dark hierarchy of race hate expounded by 
nazi ideology paramount above the hate of slavic  
peoples was the hatred for the jews jews had 
been persecuted in germany since the nazis had  
first come to power in the occupied territories 
of eastern europe in the wake of the war the nazi  
racial ideology was played out to its logical 
and horrific conclusion jews in poland had been  
forced into ghettos and into special labor camps 
on june 1st 1942 a polish underground newspaper  
published in defiance of the occupation printed 
rumors of systematic killings within these camps
[Music]   stalin thought the germans would once more 
attack moscow instead hitler aimed at the  
destruction of soviet troops and the capture 
of the southern russian industrial region  
including the vital strategic 
resource of the caucasus oil fields  
in a renewed offensive german armies swept south 
once again vast advances were made huge numbers of  
prisoners taken whole russian armies fled in route 
german attacks advanced through fleeing russians  
running in panic russian soldiers ordered to 
attack simply got out of their tanks and ran  
for the first and only time in the war 
stalin ordered a strategic retreat the  
key point for this campaign was the city 
of stalingrad the capture of the city  
on a major bend of the river dawn would give the 
germans a powerful strategic position thrusting  
down southwards to dominate and roll up all of 
southern russia or to stab northwards at moscow
stalin had been a political commissar during 
the russian civil war in the 1920s he had been  
stationed at the city that now bore his name 
and appreciated the importance of the city  
as the nazi armies drove even closer to stalingrad   stalin reinforced his armies there 
making the city a decisive battleground
with the entry of the united states into the 
war the battle of the atlantic the war of   supply fought against german u-boats assumed even 
greater importance yet all the lessons of dealing  
with u-boats learned by the british navy had to 
be slowly relearned by the us navy the americans  
did not introduce convoys in american waters in 
what the kriegsmarine the german navy came to call  
the second happy time german u-boats sank huge 
numbers of unescorted merchant ships many in u.s  
coastal waters many of them tankers carrying 
oil from the southern us and the caribbean  
the ships sailing up the coast were silhouetted 
by the lights of u.s towns and cities not blacked  
out they presented easy targets to hardened and 
experienced german submariners the most ferocious  
and bitter fighting at sea was in this war of 
supply the attack and defense of convoys the  
most vicious fighting in this battle took place 
in the convoys to the soviet union these sailed  
from ports in britain and iceland through the icy 
arctic waters of the norwegian and barren seas  
close to german occupied territory and in winter 
forced even closer to the norwegian coast by  
icebergs the convoys had to sail under constant 
attack and suffered the highest losses of any  
allied shipping in the war the ships carried goods 
of all sorts the supplies of american trucks of  
telephones and even of boots were vital in helping 
the soviet union repel the german attacks of 1942  
at first the allied ships sailed unmolested   a product of german confidence that 
operation barbarossa would be successful  
as this confidence faded the importance of 
this supply route grew in german eyes [Music]  
attacks came from yupos destroyers and aircraft 
based in norway even on occasions german  
battleships broke out with cruiser support 
mounting attacks in fleet formation in one  
terrible action a convoy was ordered to 
scatter in the face of attack by a german   battleship force individual ships were then picked 
off by submarines and aircraft in this one action  
2 500 aircraft an entire air force and nearly 
500 tanks were sent to the bottom of the sea  
it was not until nearly the end of the cold war 
that the soviet historians came to acknowledge  
the sacrifice of british and american seamen and 
the role of the supplies they carried [Music]  
the british admirals pleaded that the convoys were 
expensive in manpower and shipping but within the  
anti-nazi alliance the grand alliance as churchill 
came to name it the arctic convoys were the only  
answer to stalin's demands that britain open 
another front to relieve the pressure on russia  
within the alliance churchill was under great 
pressure to act the americans underestimated the  
resources and general difficulty of acting against 
nazi germany british communists under orders from  
moscow switched from preaching defeatism 
to demanding that britain act in the west  
churchill always preferred the indirect strategy 
and wanted to defeat the axis in north africa  
and then spread the war to italy attacking 
what he called the soft underbelly of the axis
on april 10th great britain gave its 
highest award for civilian bravery   the george cross to the entire island of 
malta [Music] no part of british territory  
throughout the entire war endured such regular 
and heavy attacks as the mediterranean colony  
in the first four months of 1942 malta had 
suffered no less than 1 000 air attacks  
the civilian population became a nation of 
cave dwellers digging deep into the island's  
limestone the constant air attacks were just part 
of the siege which the axis extended around malta  
the planes flew from sicily a mere 160 
kilometers across the sea they bombarded  
the island itself and any shipping that attempted 
to bring supplies to the beleaguered defenders
at times the attacks were so fierce that the 
only vessels capable of making the voyage  
were submarines the passage of some convoys grew 
into full naval battles drawing in the italian  
fleet the defense of the island was to be the 
product of constant and repeated acts of daring  
the siege was a battle fought to a medieval 
script where starvation and disease were the  
weapons of the procedure a typhoid epidemic swept 
throughout the population who were surviving  
on as little as 1500 calories per adult per day 
malta was a prize worth having to both sides  
she sat astride the short sea routes to north 
africa and unless captured and in ax's hands  
could threaten disaster to the 
axis armies fighting in the desert
[Music] in north africa new supplies had 
enabled germany's africa corps to bounce  
back from a british offensive of the previous 
year once more with inspired leadership from  
rommel the front moved back hundreds of miles 
across libya in what was now named the british  
eighth army there was a panic route with men 
fleeing for survival the retaking of airfields  
by the germans in libya tightened the siege of 
malta and aided the supply of the africa corps
in a renewed offensive the africa corps attacked 
and retook the strategically important port of  
to brook this latest failure of the british 
a defeat despite clear intelligence from code  
breakers the german attack was coming resulted 
in the dismissal of yet another british general  
lieutenant general richie 
commander of the eighth army   was sacked the commander-in-chief in the middle 
east achenlec took command of the army himself  
to brooks fall yielded the germans 35 000 british 
prisoners and brought about a crisis in britain  
secret opinion polls showed more than half the 
british people dissatisfied with churchill's  
leadership and thought the war badly directed 
churchill had to face a vote of confidence in  
parliament 476 members voted in support but 
25 voted against and 30 british mps abstained
the germans pushed into egypt soon they would 
be within 100 kilometers of the crucial port of  
alexandria within reach of cutting the suez canal 
striking at the middle east oil fields of winning  
the war after the enormous tactical victory of 
pearl harbor sane heads in the japanese high  
command had warned that the forces of the empire 
had only a little time in which to win victory  
in may 1942 six months following pearl harbor 
japan mounted an invasion of port moresby  
in papua new guinea their aim was to extend 
their control so as to isolate australia from  
the rest of her allies to bring australia 
easily within reach of japanese aircraft  
a japanese invasion force that comprised of 
troop transporters heavy warships and three  
aircraft carriers was met by the american navy 
with two carriers plus an anglo-australian fleet  
once again warning of the japanese attack came 
through intelligence gathered by code breakers
the battle fought between the 
two forces was to be known   as the battle of the coral sea this was the 
first naval action in history that was fought  
carrier to carrier the first in which two 
opposing navies never even sighted each other
[Music] in fighting that lasted four days the two 
sides fought to a stalemate one japanese  
aircraft carrier was sunk one american carrier 
so badly damaged that she had to be scuttled of  
the two other japanese carriers one lost so many 
aircraft her strike power was heavily depleted  
the other carrier so badly damaged has 
to be out of action for the coming months  
once again the battle was a tactical success 
for japan but a strategic failure new guinea  
was not conquered and the strategic 
goal to threaten australia unattained  
that such losses were inflicted on japan's 
hard to replace ships planes and trained pilots  
would be crucially significant when the two 
navies next met battleships were no longer  
the major weapon of naval warfare no longer a 
weapon which could destroy the enemy's main fleet  
battleships were still a threat if such a 
warship fell among a convoy of merchant ships  
or if a battleship were brought to bombard short 
targets provided there was no threat of air  
attack the big gun ship could reap terrible damage 
otherwise the battleship on both sides were little  
more than prestige propaganda targets threats only 
in that admirals in the opposing navies believe  
battleship's a threat in february 1942 three 
large german ships the battle cruisers scharnhorst  
nisnow and the cruiser prince oygen daringly 
dashed up the english channel under the  
noses of the british the german action 
though daring was still a run for cover
in the vast spaces of russia the greatest battles 
of the war continued as the soviet union defended  
itself against german invasion the german soviet 
conflict dominates world war ii in terms of the  
vast distances the huge numbers of forces involved 
every other campaign is dwarfed in the first six  
months of operation barbarossa when german troops 
had made deep and dramatic thrusts into the ussr  
taking millions of prisoners vast areas of the 
soviet union came under nazi control in many areas  
the german troops were welcomed as liberators from 
stalinism this attack had been halted by desperate  
counter-attacks in the snows of winter as the 
last russian reserves were thrown into action  
through the winter months of 1942 stalin had 
ordered attacks everywhere russian soldiers  
attacked a german army then unprepared for winter 
fighting and their attacks met with success  
the german army had cautiously avoided major 
actions and allowed the soviets to push west  
stretching communication lines and draining 
large numbers of troops into vulnerable positions  
when the russian summer returned the german 
army went once more on the offensive [Music]
the mathematics of the war were shifting slowly   against the germans in early summer the red army 
had five and a half million soldiers deployed  
the germans just under 5 million of which 400 
000 were finns and just under a million were axis  
allies a mixture of italians hungarians romanians 
and even a division of spanish volunteers  
the crucial german advantages of 
better equipment better training   and better leadership were being slowly eroded 
by the support of britain and america as russia's  
quantity of forces became comparable in quality 
the balance was to slowly tip against the nazis
barely a month after the battle of the coral sea 
and little more than six months after pearl harbor  
a truly decisive battle of the pacific war 
would be fought the japanese high command  
resolved to end the war to win a victory that 
would knock the united states out of the war  
the japanese plan was based on classic naval 
strategy aiming to force the us navy into battle  
on japanese terms the plan was to attack the u.s 
island of midway midway was the furthest west u.s  
held territory in the pacific the attack 
would lure the u.s pacific fleet into a battle  
which would bring about its destruction japanese 
admiral yamamoto planned to make the americans  
weaken their defenses by making a faint towards 
the american aleutian islands far to the north  
yamamoto believed that following this victory the 
invasion and japanese occupation of hawaii would  
follow this in turn would enable the japanese 
navy to drive the us fleet from the ocean  
even for japanese forces to directly threaten 
the west coast of the continental united states  
america would as a result sue for peace the 
japanese admirals plan involved the concentration  
of a massive fleet 145 ships strong once again 
the work of the code breaker was to be crucial  
the breaking of the japanese codes revealed 
that the aleutian attack was a sham  
and midway the real target the american navy 
was therefore able to concentrate its defenses  
nevertheless the material advantage lay with 
the japanese four carriers to the us navy's  
three 261 planes of the highest quality 
against a mixed bag of 230 u.s aircraft  
the japanese force also contained five 
heavily armed powerful battleships  
japanese made several errors which were to have 
a disastrous outcome photo reconnaissance of  
pearl harbor which would have shown the base 
empty was cancelled a screen of submarines was  
deployed to the east of midway island too late 
after the us fleet had already passed through  
yamamoto expected his powerful fleet of 
four carriers to easily take the island  
he expected then a weak divided enemy 
diverted by his northern dummy attack  
instead he was entering a battle where the 
initiative the surprise actually lay with  
the united states navy the heart of the japanese 
navy the aircraft carriers supported by a small  
fleet of both smaller warships and battleships 
with invasion forces aboard sailed for midway
the japanese plan was complex and intricate 
yet lacked in crucial details incredibly  
japan was misled by false intelligence into 
an american deception that a carrier the uss  
yorktown had sunk following the battle of 
the coral sea knowing the japanese plans  
the united states navy made a series of false 
signals that implied what yamamoto believed  
to be the last two remaining u.s carriers 
enterprise and hornet were nowhere near midway  
in fact they were there ready and waiting 
preparing a surprise attack of their own  
with the third totally unexpected 
carrier the supposed sunk yorktown
through a combination of daring gamble luck and 
inspiration the us aircraft caught the japanese  
carriers by surprise the japanese approached 
midway island and made their first attacks  
unaware that the u.s navy had 
such a powerful force in hand
good fortune and daring by the united 
states admirals overconfidence by the  
japanese commanders resulted in the japanese 
carriers caught with their planes on deck  
refueling and rearming american bombers 
made a series of devastating attacks  
three japanese carriers were destroyed in minutes 
the fourth carrier attacked and severely damaged  
the u.s carrier before herself being 
destroyed in another american attack
the u.s navy had torn the heart from its opponent 
never again would japan be able to fight with a  
numerical advantage over the americans the war 
between america and japan was only six months old  
it still had over three years to run yet already 
it could be said to be moving to the end game  
the battle of midway was a 
decisive day in the pacific war   within the space of hours the balance of 
power had shifted against the japanese  
american industry could easily replace the last 
aircraft and the lost ships but japan could not  
its force of skilled pilots and crews were lost 
to a man japan would never regain the initiative  
the long march to defeat and 
surrender for japan had begun [Music]  
next time on world war ii the complete history   the africa corps broadcast to egypt they tell 
the ladies of cairo be ready for us tonight  
this is a date the africa corps break as the 
british army fight the germans to a standstill  
at el alamein in yet another change of british 
commander a newly appointed general is sent  
to lead the eighth army in the desert general 
richard gott takes command and on his first day  
is kill a hurried search for a replacement 
throws up a stand-in who will march into history  
the second choice general bernard montgomery steps 
in to lead the british empire forces and creates  
a legend to match that of his opponent irwin 
rummel the day after montgomery takes command  
the german army comes before stalingrad and 
the decisive battle of the european war begins  
in the west british and canadian forces carried 
the war to the germans as a powerful raid is  
mounted on dm it is a defeat for the allies but 
vital lessons are learnt montgomery shatters the  
myth of rummel at the second battle of el alamein 
it's a stunning victory which churchill calls the  
end of the beginning america goes on the offensive 
guate canal is recaptured from the japanese  
american forces land in north africa and meet 
an army of the third reich for the first time
the skies of germany begin to fill with 
the planes of the united states air force  
at a meeting of roosevelt and 
churchill the ultimate war aim   is spelt out to nazism it is 
to be unconditional surrender
[Music]
[Music]
in the late autumn of 1942 the 
war had reached a turning point  
in just months the fortunes of japan have crashed 
to disaster from a seemingly never-ending catalog  
of victories only months before 
thousands of american troops   surrendered as the philippines fell thousands 
of british empire troops passed into captivity  
as japan won a dramatic victory against 
the imperial fortress of singapore
japanese power had come to dominate 
the western pacific and southern asia   japanese troops threatened india the jewel in the 
crown of the british empire with the naval battles  
of first the coral sea and then most decisively 
midway the balance of power in the pacific  
moved into america's favor now japan would 
be forced to react against american attacks  
months after beginning the war with victory 
after victory japan is now on the defensive  
in the arctic ocean a sea battle no less vital 
than that of midway is fought as convoys carrying  
supplies to the soviet union fight their way 
through ice storms and constant german attack  
everywhere the fortune of war is turning   after the last ditch defense of moscow russian 
counter-attacks through the snows of winter have  
stemmed the tide of german conquest in the east 
hitler has ordered a great offensive once more  
vast advances are made and thousands of prisoners 
are taken the objective of the germans is southern  
russia its oil fields and industrial resources the 
decisive strategic point is the city of stalingrad
in the skies of germany the first 
mass bomber raids are begun by the raf  
in one night 1 000 raf planes 
attacked cologne in the mediterranean  
and north africa the africa corps stand poised 
to sweep into egypt and into the middle east the  
british empire forces await attack in the desert 
at el alamein they are the last line of defense
the war in the western desert was characterized by 
huge movement with armies covering vast distances  
successful offensives often grinding to a halt 
through armies outrunning their supply lines  
early in june the africa corps had thrust deep 
into egypt rolling back the eighth army once  
more the british were now close to defeat they had 
prepared defensive positions at a place called el  
alamein terrain meant that el alamein was 
the gateway to egypt defeat here would mean  
that raul could break out to attack suez and 
threaten arabia as the british troops awaited  
attack british bases in egypt were evacuated 
on july 1st the africa corps prepared to smash  
down the door they were 100 kilometers from cairo 
their radio station made a propaganda broadcast  
they told the ladies of cairo to be ready for 
them tonight the battle that followed what was  
to become known as the first battle of el alamein 
will be forever the subject of historical debate  
were rommel's forces completely exhausted and out 
of supply or was a brilliant last-ditch defense  
organized by the british general arkanland the 
narrowness of the front the lack of supplies  
the well-prepared static defenses resulted in 
rumble being stopped both sides came to a halt
churchill saw the campaign in 
the desert of crucial importance   he believed a defeat for the axis in the 
desert would lead to an invasion of italy  
and enable a strike at what he called 
the soft underbelly of the axis
churchill constantly gave advice to whichever 
general commander was in the desert a succession  
of officers had failed to meet his expectations 
churchill thinking aachenlec not aggressive enough  
sacked yet another commander he appointed a 
new commander for the 8th army william god god  
took his appointment up on the 6th of august on 
august 7th god was killed in a plane crash [Music]  
there was a hurried search for a replacement 
which brought forward a legend of the war  
lieutenant general bernard montgomery a fanatical 
perfectionist who had studied warfare extensively  
was to become the most successful and famous 
british general of the war unlike rubble who  
was an improviser a quick thinker montgomery 
was called the master of the set piece  
he was determined to gain victory at the least 
cost in life and believed in painstaking planning  
and preparation assembling an overwhelming force 
before any operation leaving nothing to chance  
montgomery's technical genius was matched by an 
ability to communicate and inspire the ordinary  
soldier instilling incredible self-belief and 
confidence in those he commanded those who served  
under him came to have complete and utter faith 
in his leadership montgomery's failing was conceit  
other generals soldiers of allied armies 
came to find him unbearable to work with
montgomery had an immediate 
effect galvanizing the eighth army   restoring morale straight away warned by 
good intelligence of rommel's plans to attack  
and break through once more montgomery made 
careful preparations for which he was failed  
coordinating the attacks by the raf's western 
desert air force and beat off the attack
montgomery promptly began planning for a 
long set piece that would win the desert war
one of montgomery's greatest obstacles 
was his opponent irwin rummel   not just the german general's technical 
ability but the legend of the man  
in the western desert rommel had won such 
stunning victories by unconventional and  
unpredictable actions many british officers 
thought rommel unbeatable the africa corps was  
a small force a tiny fraction of that deployed 
against the soviet union had rammel's genius  
been given a small part of the strength allotted 
to russia he would have undoubtedly driven the  
british from egypt and possibly have won 
the war for germany as it was rommel once  
more stood at a halt his advance restricted 
by a shortage of material for war [Music]
a war of extreme mobility had suddenly become 
fixed with trenches and extensive minefields on  
both sides it was a situation for the set piece 
planned battle at which montgomery excelled
on september 23rd 1942 rommel fell ill and 
returned to germany he was absent for one month  
all through october montgomery built up the eighth 
army strength planning the second battle of el  
alamein a large force of artillery was assembled 
with huge stocks of ammunition every spare tank  
was put into place the individual units were 
trained and trained again into specialist roles
to hide the complex british preparations 
diversions and deceptions were made to mislead  
the germans the defenders were taken totally by 
surprise when the british empire troops attacked  
on the night of october 23rd rommel was summoned 
from sick leave to the battle the battle opened  
with intense and prolonged artillery barrage teams 
of engineers cleared the dense german minefields  
montgomery appreciated the value of air power 
and organized closely coordinated air support
the battle lasted 12 days as montgomery's plan 
was methodically enacted german counter-attacks  
were met with heavy air and artillery bombardment 
the german counter-attack as montgomery planned  
drew german forces away from where 
the next british attack was planned
[Music]
[Music]
thirty thousand german prisoners were taken 
the remainder of the nazi army fled in retreat  
across libya this second battle of el alamein 
lasted 12 days and was just one of any number  
of battles in the war but the effect 
of the british victory was electrifying  
for the first time german forces had been 
defeated in a strategically decisive confrontation  
the german war effort in north africa would not 
recover churchill was to say this is not the end  
it is not even the beginning of the end 
but it is perhaps the end of the beginning  
war brings innovation in weaponry and tactics one 
of the most lasting inventions of world war ii is  
not a weapon but a way of fighting the war in the 
desert in the vast spaces that existed behind the  
front lines new types of units were deployed the 
british armies formed a group which carved out  
a special place in military history the special 
air service regiment the sas remained unseen to  
the regular army it has its origins amongst 
odd strange irregular units the special boat  
section of britain's royal marines sections of 
the greek sacred regiment a group of fanatically  
loyal greek officers and free french paratroopers 
these embryonic special forces operated in small  
units deep behind german lines gathering 
intelligence attacking german airfields the  
special forces then as now were outsiders full of 
men who did not fit into the normal military mold
the numbers of the war were 
slowly turning against germany   as more and more forces came 
into action against them
on november 8th in operation torch a 
combined american and british force  
made amphibious landings in north africa 
in morocco and algeria these territories  
were then french colonies and held by the troops 
of the collaborationist vichy regime the invasion  
was the first of a series of actions that would in 
the end result in the invasion of france in 1944  
the campaign was thought the best way to introduce 
the inexperienced american army against the  
third reich 65 000 americans landed the overall 
command of the operation was under the direction  
of american general dwight eisenhower 
amongst the american officers were many  
men who would later rise to prominence 
including mark clark and george s patton
the campaign involved detailed coordination 
of the armed forces of different nations   and close integration of army 
navy and air force [Music]
it was not the second front that stalin had 
demanded of his western allies but it still worked  
to relieve the pressure on the russians the attack 
increased pressures on rumble attacking his rear  
the campaign ran into complicated politics of 
vichy france of conflicting loyalties some french  
commanders went over to the allies some fiercely 
resisted the capture of algiers cost the lives of  
fourteen hundred americans and 700 french some 
french both refused to surrender and refuse to  
fight the remains of the french navy stationed 
at bases in north africa chose to scuttle itself  
the axis responded by pouring troops into north 
africa rommel found the fighting on this second  
front difficult the italians restricting the 
german freedom to respond and used their great  
strength of mobility the terrain was unlike that 
of libya and western egypt difficult and unhelpful  
to mobile warfare a result of north african 
landings was an end to the supposed freedom of  
vichy france the german army occupied southern 
france bringing their domination to the whole  
of french territory their aim was to protect 
the country from british and american invasion
the second battle of el alamein 
and the arrival of the americans   moved the war on north africa into the end game
elsewhere in the world war new campaigns were 
opening on august 7th 1942 u.s forces attacked  
the pacific island of guadalcanal since the 
japanese invasion of the philippines the  
armies of the japanese empire and america 
had not met the fighting on gradle canal  
a remote and tiny british colony part of the 
solomon islands archipelago was to be lengthy  
and bloody nineteen thousand u.s marines and 
the naval force of three aircraft carriers made  
the first assault the aim of the us was to prevent 
japanese expansion southwards the americans landed  
unopposed but the japanese responded sending a 
bomber attack and a strong naval force the threat  
of air attack forced the u.s carriers to withdraw 
and the naval force defeated the u.s ships  
with command of the sea japan landed troops on 
the island the battle was to drag on for months
the u.s marines captured and held the island's 
airstrip u.s construction battalions cps  
labored under fire to build and 
maintain the field as operational   as a result a small u s air force 
flew from the island itself [Music]  
hand to hand close infantry action on the island 
was matched by a series of powerful naval battles
over the months the numbers fighting over the 
small patch of earth escalated at the start  
of the campaign in august the united states 
landed ten thousand of its intended garrison  
the japanese had just two thousand by mid-november 
29 000 americans were opposed by 30 000 japanese
mid-november saw a titanic sea battle what became 
known as the battle of guadalcanal as a japanese  
invasion force with massive reinforcements 
was intercepted by the u.s navy and air forces  
some taking off from the island's own airfield 
whilst under fire from massive battleship guns  
two huge japanese battleships were 
sunk american aircraft fought past   japanese defenses and attacked the transport ships  
the destruction of japanese naval superiority in 
the area was the key to eventual victory on land  
following the battle in mid-november japan 
could only supply its troops by sudbury  
by december first american forces stood at 
forty thousand the japanese twenty five thousand  
as 1942 turned to 1943 u s forces numbered 
fifty thousand well-supplied troops  
against dwindling japanese running out 
of supplies at the end of january the  
remaining japanese slipped away leaving 
the americans in command of guadalcanal
the cost was high to the us a carrier and many 
smaller ships sunk many other warships severely  
damaged and nearly 2 000 died for a small patch 
of territory but guadalcanal was a battle on land  
to match that of midway at sea a defeat from which 
japan never fully recovered the initiative in the  
war passed to the united states ever after japan 
could only react defending against u.s attacks
[Music]   all through 1942 in burma the british had been 
fighting what was to become one of the least  
known campaigns of the war the british army 
that fought in burma came to call themselves  
the forgotten army to call the army 
that fought this war a british army  
would be wrong the majority of the soldiers 
were indian but also present were the  
distinctive native peoples of burma the bermans 
the karen's the catchings the nagas and the chins  
plus chinese and gurkhas and black 
soldiers from east and west africa  
terrain determines the nature of warfare burma 
offered a diverse landscape that made for warfare  
of a dramatically divergent nature fighting took 
place in dense steaming jungle in mountains on  
wide plains that were suited to tank action on 
large rivers in coastal waters [Laughter] [Music]
burma was used as a shop window for the 
japanese concept of anti-colonialism  
eventually they would declare the 
country liberated and independent   following their invasion the japanese 
had swept northward through burma  
through 1942 the british forces made the longest 
fighting retreat in british military history  
as 1942 turned to 1943 yet another tide of war had 
reached its furthest point the japanese invasion  
had been halted at the border to india and the 
british were once more planning another attack  
in august war returned to mainland western europe 
as a combined force of canadian british american  
and free french mounted a raid upon the french 
channel port of diablo the aim of the attack  
was to seize the town and systematically destroy 
its defenses coastal artillery a radar station  
and the german divisional headquarters the 
motive for the attack was mostly political  
it was to show stalin that his western allies 
were doing something in the west that would force  
hitler to withdraw troops from the eastern 
front the raid was in part an experiment  
to test the defenses of germany in the west a 
preparation for an eventual invasion of liberation
dieppe was a disaster of six thousand 
one hundred men who started the attack  
four thousand one hundred did not return 
the bulk of the force were canadian soldiers  
nearly one thousand canadians were killed and 
fifteen hundred taken prisoners before leaving to  
take up command in north africa general montgomery 
had demanded the death raid be cancelled  
he insisted it was poorly planned and doomed to 
fail responsibility passed to louis mountbatten  
a highly ambitious naval officer lacking an 
experience who had risen quickly owing not a  
little to his membership of the british royal 
family the raid was reactivated churchill was  
eager to take offensive action and dismiss 
the objections of the professional soldiers  
who were pessimistic mountbatten's ambition made 
him keen to make his mark fearful of interference  
by skeptics mountbatten shrouded his plans for 
the raid in excessive secrecy officers who should  
have known heads of intelligence for all three 
services were excluded from the plans [Music]  
the failure of the raid was due to poor planning 
and wild over optimism the canadians were eager  
to taste action for the first time and were not 
fully trained there was poor reconnaissance and  
intelligence plans were based on pre-war holiday 
photos no one knew exactly what german units  
awaited them the raf could not be persuaded to 
release heavy bombers from attacks over germany  
the navy would not risk battleships to provide 
heavy guns to shell the coast admiralty  
intelligence on the very day of the raid warned 
that german naval forces operating off the coast  
would mean that surprise essential 
to success would be impossible
the lack of surprise the absence of heavy 
support meant that the raiding troops rarely  
left the landing beaches and were slaughtered 
by the germans one destroyer and 33 landing  
craft were destroyed the raf had supplied fighter 
cover but lost 106 planes to 48 from the luftwaffe  
the raid is held up as a textbook example 
of how not to mount such operations  
the story of dieppe displays the classic 
ingredients of poor planning poor intelligence  
of over optimism and political interference 
that contribute to military disaster [Music]  
the soldiers who died or passed into captivity 
did not make their sacrifices in vain  
two years later the allied armies would 
return to the northern coast of france   and display lessons learned on the beaches 
of dieppe to liberate france from occupation
[Music] this is a secret film shot in paris a 
camera is hidden in the basket of a bicycle  
as it weaves through the streets of the german 
occupied capital the territory under occupation  
by invaders reached its greatest extent in 1942 
vast areas of both europe asia and the pacific  
were under the control of foreign armies the 
experience of occupation whether harsh or benign  
the attitude of the occupied weather of resistance 
acceptance or open collaboration varied widely  
across the different countries cultures and 
societies that endured defeat and subjection  
the experience of occupation always asks difficult 
questions of the present often creating history  
that survivors wish to forget it's too easy 
for people who've never lived under occupation  
never had to answer such questions of the past to 
condemn those who acquiesce to their conquerors  
french resistance took many forms differing 
in degree and type resistance could be simple  
non-cooperation with the germans resistance could 
be the sabotage of war work in the factories  
escaped prisoners of war downed 
airmen avoiding capture could be aided  
resistance could involve the production of 
underground media publishing the truth about  
the war of course most dangerous was what is most 
easily imagined to be resistance guerrilla warfare  
the attacks upon communications and military 
facilities and direct assaults upon the  
occupiers with ambushes and assassinations but 
there were many who were willing to collaborate  
many for whom life went on as usual prominent 
among the armed french resistance was the maki  
the maki were usually young frenchmen who took 
to france's forests and mountains the ranks of  
the marquis were greatly swelled when germany 
with the collaboration of the vichy government  
introduced the conscription and deportation 
of labor to work in the german war industry  
history gives us a blurred picture a good number 
of mackie simply wished to avoid capture others  
armed and trained by the british and americans 
were to become formidable enemies of the germans  
in some countries that endured occupation the war 
split those societies down existing fracture lines  
forcing apart old wounds yugoslavia had been 
swiftly conquered in 1941 its army collapsing  
before german invasion the axis dismembered 
yugoslavia some areas were annexed by germany  
some areas were occupied by the italians some 
by hungary some by bulgaria and some by albania  
a so-called independent state of croatia was 
established it was a state organized on nazi lines  
and a rump of serbian territory endured the 
full force of occupation by the german army
within these statelets the many minorities of 
this corner of europe took sides croatian forces  
the paramilitary ushtas sided with the nazis 
resistance forces were divided between yugoslav  
nationalists the remnants of the army called 
chetniks and communist partisans the albanians  
sided with the invaders sometimes chetnik fought 
alongside communist partisan against occupier  
sometimes chetnick and partisan fought each other 
sometimes chetnik fought alongside the nazis  
sometimes partisan fought partisan sometimes 
chetnick fought chetnik overlaid were endless  
small groupings and loyalties where resistance 
fighters merged with bandits there were no  
clear battle lines the relationships and 
alliances shifted from village to village  
during the occupation 1.2 million yugoslavs 
died most at the hands of other yugoslavs
the vast spaces of russia created 
a different type of resistance  
political activists communist party members 
were ordered to stay behind and together with  
stragglers from the red army organized 
a guerrilla campaign against the germans  
attacking lines of communication assassinating 
russians that they thought were collaborating  
partisan bands were typically based in 
the forests and wildernesses of russia  
the partisans were political as much as military 
stalin wished to show the civilian population that  
communism could not be eliminated stalin 
aimed to make the soviet people fear him  
more than hitler partisans received little support 
from the civilians who in many places allied with  
the germans to eliminate resistance activity in 
some occupied territories the resistance forces  
and the population where one in the same in 
occupied crete the german forces fought a  
continuous and violent war a population with a 
long history of fierce resistance to invasion  
british officers often classical scholars were 
able to melt into the population and organize  
the fighting the population bore the reprisals the 
massacres as part of war at the other end of the  
spectrum some states preserved civilian lives 
and the structure of their society by simply  
accommodating the occupiers denmark geared 
itself to supporting the german war effort  
and in return retained danish control over 
much of the administration of german affairs
the amphibious operation by the us marines in 
the pacific is one of the iconic images of the  
second world war the taking of islands rolling 
back japanese conquests step by step island by  
island beach by beach was the major feature of 
u.s strategy the aim to establish bases close  
enough to the japanese home islands that would 
enable both a strategic bomber offensive and  
an eventual invasion the amphibious attack with 
marines storming ashore beach with support from  
carrier aircraft and the heavy guns of battleships 
then to slowly painfully drive tenacious japanese  
from prepared positions was but one side of the us 
strategy second was an offensive by u.s submarines  
japan had to transport huge numbers of troops 
vast quantities of arms ammunition aircraft food  
and all the materials of war needed to capture 
and hold the pacific island territories  
the usa declared unrestricted submarine warfare 
against japan and until the end of the war  
mounted an ever tighter grip that 
amounted in the end to a total blockade
the japanese navies stressed decisive action and 
thought convoy escort degrading even dishonorable  
american submarines were technically the best 
their radar far ahead of that used by japan  
and the captains highly aggressive the eventual 
result was the american submarine force was to do  
what germany's u-boats failed to do
in 1942 war had reached a turning point in north 
africa at el alamein and in the pacific at midway  
in russia the decisive battle of the european war 
one of the crucial events in the timeline of the  
20th century was coming to pass at stalingrad 
stalingrad was a russian city that stood at  
the edge of asia hitler had expected that his 
renewed offensive would sweep into southern  
russia and the ukraine it was an offensive 
to take hold of russia's great natural wealth  
wheat fields mines factories and oil fields he 
intended to seize these lands and then to build  
what he called a great east wall the invasion had 
already captured half of the soviet union's grain  
two-thirds of its coal iron and aluminum nearly 
half of the ussr's population was under occupation  
to capture the oil of the communists could be the 
final blow that would render bolshevism impotent  
the germans believed that victory at stalingrad   would complete the destruction of the 
soviet forces causing all to collapse
the task given to the german armies was not 
one soldiers relish armies used to maneuvering  
in open country to wars of vast advances were 
asked to capture a large city street by street  
for stalin the battle of stalingrad was 
of central importance the military and  
strategic importance of the city compounded by 
the political damage that the loss of the city  
carrying the dictator's name would bring
on september 30th the germans held two-thirds 
of stalingrad hitler broadcast to the world  
that the city would fall stalin decided 
that the city was to be held at any cost
russian reinforcements were poured into 
the city the soviets deployed special   units of devoted communists behind their lines 
their task was to shoot any russian deserting  
many thousands of russians were ruthlessly 
killed by their own side in this way
the thrust of stalingrad had produced a great 
dent in the front line between the two armies  
with stalin granted the apex to reinforce 
the attack on the city elite german troops  
were withdrawn from the sides of that dent their 
places were taken by weaker romanian hungarian  
and italian units it was to be a crucial mistake 
by the germans the fighting was street by street  
room by room house by house the front 
line a doorway a corridor a ceiling  
the lines of supply staircases sewers and chimneys 
the germans ground the soviets back and back  
and eventually by november 19th had encircled 
the city completely but on that same day a  
massive russian counter-attack began the romanian 
armies protecting the germans collapsed and seven  
days later the russian armies met entombing the 
german sixth army the procedures were besieged
hitler ordered the sixth army not to attempt to 
break out and ordered a break in by german forces  
the luftwaffe promised to keep the 
german army supplied from the air  
the numbers were working against the nazis 
already the aircraft needed for stalingrad  
were also needed in north africa the break-in was 
not strong enough a grim and desperate siege began  
the fighting over the coming weeks was to 
determine the outcome of the war in europe
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
[Music]
[Music]  
the siege of stalingrad in the south 
was mirrored by the attack on leningrad  
in the north the siege of leningrad was not 
so much a siege aimed to capture the city  
but a blockade deliberately designed 
to destroy the city in its population  
the city had been encircled within weeks 
of the start of operation barbarossa  
the demand on german strength to fight 
elsewhere meant the attackers had not   the resources to overwhelm leningrad hitler 
ordered that no surrender was to be accepted  
and the city and its population be destroyed 
by bombing shelling starvation and disease
in addition to the defenders leningrad had a 
population of two and a half million civilians  
the city was not completely surrounded a slender 
lifeline existed across the waters of lake lagoda  
supplies came by this route on boat in summer 
across the ice in winter the german navy  
operated motor torpedo boats and the italian 
navy [ __ ] submarines in attempts to cut this  
slender lifeline by november 1941 the population 
was starving eating glue linseed oil dead pets  
there were even rumors of cannibalism it's thought 
that nearly one million died in the winter of 1941  
to 1942 of hunger of disease of cold
now in the summer of 1942 heavy siege artillery 
was brought to bear and extra luftwaffe planes  
deployed in an attempt to physically 
destroy the city and kill all defenders  
leningrad refused to die refused to give 
in the numbers were moving against germany  
russian reinforcements were gradually brought 
to bear against the germans in leningrad  
in early january a russian offensive broke through   and joined up to lift the siege the cracks 
were showing everywhere in nazi power [Music]
it has been said that the war actually stimulated 
a second industrial revolution in the soviet union  
bringing industry to new areas to the 
underdeveloped east of the country   stimulating and mobilizing the exploitation 
of the country's vast resources  
that second russian industrial revolution was 
the worst of bad news for the eventual fate  
of the germans german industry was still 
geared to peace and so the germans needed  
to win quick and decisive victories until 1942 
when it became clear that russia would not be  
defeated quickly hitler had directed that the 
war should not alter civilian living standards  
it was not until the spring of 
that year that germany began to   implement the changes to the economy that britain 
and america had forced on their populations  
conscripting older men and married women 
into industry to release men for the armed  
forces issuing directives that controlled 
industry focusing upon maximum war production
[Music] the arctic sea convoys to the north of 
russia were matched by supplies which entered  
through the south through iran then more usually 
known as persia ships from america would dock in  
southern persian ports and convoys of trucks would 
carry the supplies to the iranian soviet border  
in august 1941 britain and the soviet union 
invaded iran to guarantee this supply line  
effectively deposing the pro-nazi shah and 
installing his pro-allied son nearly a quarter  
of all supplies sent to the soviet union 
during the war came by this southern route
everywhere the war of numbers was 
beginning to move against the axis powers  
in attacking russia while simultaneously fighting 
america and britain hitler was making assumptions  
upon the quality of his forces and their 
weapons hitler believed that germany could  
beat superior enemies by merit of being better 
better soldiers armed with better weapons  
russia had a vast pool of manpower in space and 
rapidly mobilized to out produce the germans  
by 1943 germany was losing the war of quantity and 
as the war progressed was in many areas to lose  
that war of quality the definitive weapon of the 
land was the tank the new techniques of armored  
warfare defined the way world war ii was fought 
russia was in fact to produce the best tank of the  
war the t-34 it was produced in vast numbers and 
along with the vast numerical advantage enjoyed  
by the soviet forces its superior performance 
was a key ingredient of growing russian success
the air war in the east was in general 
fought as an adjunct to the land war  
very few raids were made by either the axis or 
soviet forces which were not made in support  
of ground attacks the giant strategic bombing 
raids made against industrial towns were unknown
1942 was the year in which those strategic 
bomber attacks began to hurt the third reich  
already the raf had mounted the first 1000 
bomber raid in august 1942 the united states  
army air force entered the campaign 
mounting its first attacks in europe  
the battle of britain and the blitz 
had convinced the raf that daylight   raids were simply too costly to mount and 
it formed the belief that nighttime raids  
were the only way to make attacks that would 
not result in heavy losses to the attackers  
precise bomb aiming was impossible at night so 
the raf made area attacks aimed at a city as a
whole the united states air force believed a 
different philosophy and equipped their b-17  
flying fortresses with specialist bomb 
aiming equipment that enabled the bomb  
aimer to actually take control of the aircraft 
in the final approach to the target aiming the  
whole plane the bomb aimer was supposedly able 
to scientifically calculate all the factors that  
affect a bomb in free fall such as weather and 
wind to drop the bomb with devastating accuracy
[Music] the b-17 was known as the flying fortress 
for its formidable armament it was a bomber that  
sprouted defensive machine guns at every angle it 
was fast and designed to fight its way through to  
its target the first us raids were against targets 
in occupied countries where mass indiscriminate  
tactics of the ref's area bombing would 
prove unacceptable killing too many civilians  
these first raids over france were accompanied by 
fighters being in range of the smaller aircraft  
and enjoyed some success when in january 1943 
the united states air force began unaccompanied  
raids against targets in germany the result 
was heavy losses from german fighter aircraft
at the turn of 1942 to 1943 some could now foresee 
the inevitable defeat of the axis as the year  
changed the definitive turning point of the war 
was building to a dramatic climax at stalingrad  
all through december and january 
the german sixth army was smashed   captured inside an ever decreasing pocket as 
the perimeters collapsed and contracted the  
airfields upon which nazi defenders depended for 
their supply gradually fell into russian hands  
wounded lay in the open day at night 
often surrounded by a pool of frozen blood  
the soldiers still fighting did 
so with fatalistic hopelessness  
hitler promoted sixth army commander 
general paulus to field marshall  
no german field marshal had ever surrendered 
on january 31st paulus did surrender  
the balance of strength now shifted 
dramatically in favor of the russians
one hundred twenty thousand germans had been 
killed ninety thousand taken prisoner three and  
a half thousand armored vehicles captured 
twelve thousand guns taken five thousand  
transport aircraft lost over a thousand 
fighters and bombers destroyed or captured  
neither germany's air force or germany's army 
would ever recover from the losses of stalingrad
stalingrad's impact on the 
numbers of war was great   but it is the impact of the victory upon the 
morale and will of the german armed forces  
that was truly catastrophic nazi soldiers many 
of them so young as to have been children when  
hitler seized power had come to believe that 
russians were intervention sub-human now the  
aryan master race had been humiliated the common 
soldiers out fought the generals out thought the  
legend of the unstoppable blitzkrieg machine lay 
shattered in the rubble and snow of stalingrad
as the horror of stalingrad was played out 
churchill and roosevelt met at casablanca  
they met to decide the future of the war   the leaders resolved on a war aim that would have 
been understood in the streets sellers and rubble  
of stalingrad there were to be no deals the aim 
was unconditional surrender of the axis next time  
on world war ii the complete history across 
the world the forces of the axis are in  
retreat in north africa rommel is overwhelmed 
by the allies at the battle of kazarine pass
the germans are pushed into sicily 
and then onto the mainland of italy  
italy surrenders and mussolini is deposed 
and imprisoned italy becomes another occupied  
country and a savagely disputed battlefield as 
allied forces fight their way up the peninsula  
it's a year of combined operations 
at palermo salerno and anzio
at sea the battle of the north 
atlantic turns in the allies favor   as the german u-boats are driven from the 
seas by even more powerful attacks [Music]  
in russia in pursuit of a decisive victory 
the germans initiate what remains as the  
greatest tank conflict in history as thousands 
of armored vehicles wage battle at kursk [Music]
the united states army air force and 
britain's royal air force subject the   third reich to incessant aerial attack by night 
the sledgehammer of the raf pounds cities to dust  
by day the surgeon's knife of the usaf 
attacks the heart of the nazi war machine
all over england the forces 
of america and britain gather   in preparation for the invasion 
of western europe for d-day
[Music] the fortune of war has turned its back upon the 
axis for the first time germany's soldiers have  
suffered massive and crushing defeats 
in the sands of the desert the legend  
of rommel has been shattered at el alamein in 
the smashed and tortured rubble of stalingrad  
the sixth army surrender has destroyed the myth of 
the irresistible blitzkrieg a disaster at dieppe  
and the success in north africa 
teach hard-learned lessons   as the allies develop the skills of amphibious 
warfare that will bring liberation to europe  
in the pacific us forces capitalize on the victory 
of midway rolling back the japanese at guadalcanal  
following el alamein winston churchill spoke 
of the end of the beginning for the access  
the coming days and months would 
be the beginning of the end
the battle of el alamein in november 1942 
had been decisive the africa corps had  
been forced into retreat british general 
montgomery's pursuit of the german forces  
had been so well organized that every time in this 
retreat across western egypt and then libya that  
rommel had turned and attempted to make a stand 
he had been defeated and sent on the retreat again
for the last time the war 
would sweep back across libya   across the desert over which fighting had 
raged back and forth for the previous two years
early in 1943 the africa corps had been forced 
to withdraw from the italian colony of libya  
british troops entered a tripoli 
the capital of the territory   they had expected to fight but found the city 
deserted the axis forces having withdrawn [Music]  
in the face of pursuit the africa corps and its   italian allies had withdrawn into 
the neighboring territory of tunisia  
the fighting in the desert of libya now began 
to merge with the campaigns fought by the  
axis against the anglo-american forces which had 
landed in algeria and morocco in operation torch  
the forces were mostly american and under the 
command of dwight eisenhower through late 1942  
these armies had advanced along the 
coast of algeria towards tunisia
the aim of the allies was to capture the coastal 
ports and cut the axis forces lines of supply and  
retreat to cut the axis forces in two preventing 
rummel from joining up with the other axis forces
in february it was the turn of the americans to 
encounter the genius of rama when at the battle  
of kazareen he struck as usual taking his enemy 
by surprise rommel's tanks operated in terrain  
dismissed as difficult to armor the german 
attack caught the americans unprepared  
and struck at a position that could have led 
to a decisive defeat of the allied forces  
italy though demanded caution from rommel 
and prevented him from exploiting his victory  
the battle was not decisive in any way but 
deflated the confidence of the american forces  
time and time again in the latter years of the war 
all the genius and all the determination was to be  
of no avail to the axis in early spring of 1943 
after kazarine was not exploited and the german  
and italian forces were worn down the allied 
forces were showing the coordination of air land  
and sea forces that was to characterize later 
operations the desert air force of the raf was  
increasingly effective the royal navy had imposed 
a tight sea blockade around the tunisian ports  
the axis forces were growing increasingly short 
of supplies and ammunition slowly the axis forces  
were pushed into a smaller and smaller pocket in 
early may the two german panzer armies in tunisia  
collapsed against concentrated american attacks 
from the west and from the british in the south
the last german surrendered on may thirteenth 
rommel had been ordered to germany a sick man
238 000 axis forces became prisoners
[Music]
[Music]
the operation in north africa was a slow moving 
process for the allies but lessons were learnt  
that were to pay results in the coming years the 
war on the desert had seen important operations  
by the first of what were later to be called 
the special forces it was in the western desert  
that britain's special air service regiment was 
first formed the first special forces it operated  
deep behind axis lines attacking supplies 
and airfields far away in burma in the war  
between the forces of the british empire in japan 
special forces were also to play an important role
the japanese army stood on the border of india 
seeking to invade the most important territory  
of the british empire the two armies faced 
one another across the border the british  
army making frontal counter attacks against the 
japanese that failed to beat back the invader  
the japanese lines of supply were very long and 
passed through dense jungle britain developed  
new types of unit and new tactics to attack 
these tenuous lifelines units were specially  
trained to infiltrate deep behind the rear 
of the japanese to conduct guerrilla warfare  
the troops came to be called the chindits an 
anglicized corruption of the burmese for lion  
in the first wave three thousand chindits 
entered burma they combined the traditional   with the modern chindit cut through hot malarial 
jungle with mules as their means of transport  
supplies were entirely by air enabling 
the chindits to have complete independence  
the men who became chindits were special soldiers 
who had to endure great hardship their way of  
fighting was reminiscent of guerrilla freedom 
fighters the stresses of climate and disease broke  
men easily the wounded frequently had to be left 
alone in the forests for later rescue the chimneys  
made massive sacrifices in many operations 
suffering casualties of one-third the fighting in  
burma was the longest campaign fought in the war 
and was fought by the japanese with two aims they  
plan to invade british india once liberated from 
colonial rule as the japanese called their asian  
conquests the wealth of the subcontinent would 
be used to support the japanese war economy the  
japanese also aimed to cut the only remaining land 
road by which supplies could reach and support the  
nationalist chinese forces a long tortuous 
road that wound through mountain and jungle
once they had succeeded severing this lifeline 
supplies could only reach china by air  
and a massive logistical operation was mounted 
by the united states air transport command  
to fly the material of war the air road became 
known as the hump and was hazardous for the air  
crews involved as the flights had to be made 
over high mountain ridges at the maximum height  
that the aircraft could safely operate a pilot 
might have to take off in a tropical monsoon  
fly through areas of severe turbulence 
and have to endure icing before landing  
massive resources were poured into keeping this 
air route open eventually a maximum of more than  
twenty thousand u s airmen forty seven thousand 
civilians and three hundred aircraft were used  
britain and america saw the campaign differently 
the british under general william slim fought to  
defend territory for the sake of defending 
territory to protect their indian empire  
the british forces aimed to push back the 
japanese down the length of burma with burma's  
long coastline an obvious strategy would have been 
to use the amphibious landings to outflank the  
japanese but the allied landing craft were needed 
elsewhere in the world and the british troops were  
condemned to fighting a long war on land with 
the use of the chindits deep behind enemy lines  
the british imperial forces faced an enemy 
that had long and vulnerable supply lines
[Music]   to supply their forces that stood on the border 
of india the japanese constructed the infamous  
burma railway the climate of burma's jungles 
ranks amongst the most unhealthy in the world  
the soldiers fighting on full 
rations suffered badly from disease  
japanese contempt for both the surrendered 
prisoner and of other asian peoples meant  
that the 61 000 allied prisoners of war and the 
forced native laborers that built the railway  
were forced to work under conditions of 
slavery and made to live on a starvation diet  
those allied soldiers fighting the japanese 
little knew of the suffering endured a few  
hundred miles away twelve thousand prisoners 
and ninety thousand native laborers died  
the story of the burma campaign and the railway in 
both fiction and history is infamous the americans  
saw the defense and recapture of burma as a means 
to an end believing it important to supply china  
and so place pressure on the japanese that would 
draw imperial japanese forces away from the  
pacific and perhaps to eventually use china as a 
base to carry the war to the japanese home islands  
under the leadership of u.s general stillwell 
american troops operated in northern burma and  
southern china alongside american trained 
chinese forces their goal was the creation  
of a new land route a road and oil pipeline 
between india and southern china the americans  
established air bases in southern china which 
were used to attack the japanese forces in china  
and to attack the sea lanes through which japan 
supplied its forces in the southeastern pacific
[Music] those occupied territories over which the 
japanese had spread a wave of conquest  
in a series of lightning campaigns 
in the early months of 1942   with a target throughout 1943 of a long drawn-out 
series of attacks attacks by allied forces  
aimed to roll back the japanese island by island 
archipelago by archipelago the goal of the allies  
was to shrink the perimeter of the 
vast area under japanese domination   in order that the japanese home islands be 
brought under the range of strategic bomber attack
[Music]   the allied attacks came along two lines to 
the south under general douglas macarthur  
along the large islands of the south pacific 
as the forces island hopped air bases were  
established which would control areas of 
the pacific japanese garrisons that were   bypassed would then be starved of supplies 
through air superiority blockading their enemy  
the japanese understood the allied strategy and 
although incapable of offensive action they took  
every opportunity to fortify and reinforce the 
islands they held in march 1943 at the battle  
of the bismarck sea the united states air force 
destroyed an entire japanese army division at sea  
catching the transport ships and their escorts 
unawares with a surprise low altitude attack
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all through 1943 american and australian 
forces fought to drive the japanese from  
the island of new guinea which japan had 
invaded as a stepping stone to australia  
conditions for the troops that fought 
these new guinea battles were terrible   equipment had to be carried by hand along 
jungle tracks that switched back over a  
mountainous landscape torrential rains 
turning the earth to deep mud [Music]  
supplies were brought in by air or partied from 
new guinean natives who fiercely opposed the  
japanese invaders the shortage of food 
was a constant problem for both sides  
japanese units resorted to cannibalism 
of their own and of prisoners to survive  
but by far the greatest killer 
in new guinea was malaria   which compounded with starvation claimed 
thousands of victims in both armies
much of the fighting was fought along the trails   which cut through the jungle both sides 
saw the possession of the forest pathways  
as a key to holding the island soldiers lived in 
constant fear of ambush from the dense foliage  
that surrounded them to stray from the trails into 
the forest was to risk becoming hopelessly lost  
in august 1943 the deadlock was broken when 
allied air forces were able to surprise the  
japanese aircraft on the ground and destroy 
japanese air power in new guinea from that time  
allied air superiority coupled with intelligence 
gained from decoded japanese signals meant that  
the initiative now lay with the americans and 
australians the japanese were to be driven into  
the depths of new guinea's jungles and mountains 
to carry on resistance in determined defiance
to the north of macarthur's advance the us navy 
made another strategic thrust but of a more  
revolutionary nature the southern attacks were 
short moves of little more than 100 kilometers  
they were jumps between large land masses   such projection of force through amphibious 
operations were not new in military history and  
were projections of power that the roman empire 
would recognize the massive industrial expansion  
of the allies enabled a radical projection 
of force to be made the u.s navy had been  
rebuilt following pearl harbor and had assembled 
a huge fleet of the most modern aircraft carriers  
these forces enabled the american navy to mount 
island hopping operations over massive distances  
between islands thousands of kilometers apart in 
the central pacific amongst the tiny coral atolls  
the forces of japan were everywhere outnumbered 
and in a series of operations the american forces  
drew ever closer to the home islands of 
japan the spring of 1943 saw the battle  
of the atlantic reach its climax the struggle 
between the submarines of germany and the navies  
of britain america and canada had been fought 
continuously during the whole time of the war  
it was fought to greater and lesser intensity 
with the advantage moving back and forth  
as the technology tactics and numerical strength 
available to both sides changed the german aim was  
to strangle and destroy the lifeline of maritime 
trade upon which the allied war effort depended  
convoys of merchant ships sailed the ocean under 
threat of constant attack the german u-boat crews  
knew their task to be the most dangerous of 
any servicemen the battle of the atlantic is  
at first understanding a straightforward struggle 
of numbers an algebraic equation of war the result  
the product of many factors the volume of 
supplies needed to cross the atlantic the  
extent to which the british people could tighten 
their belts the rates at which merchant ships  
and their warship escorts could be sunk the 
numbers in which u-boats could be destroyed  
the speed with which the shipyards of the 
allies and the axis could replace the losses
the spring of 1943 had seen the equation become 
ever more complex now it would be truly seen  
that the soldier fighting in the snows 
of russia and the sands of the desert   were one with the sailor and 
submariner fighting the same fight
with british and american forces now on the 
offensive in north africa and the pacific and  
indirectly supporting russian war effort it 
was the turn of the allies to be stretched  
the landing in north africa needed support 
and convoys there was more shipping at sea  
and escorts had to be spread thinner the allies 
were forced to concentrate all their transatlantic  
shipping to one route making the task of the 
u-boats easier [Music] when in early spring 1943  
the germans were able to raise the number 
of u-boats all of a sudden from nowhere   the allies were in crisis and sinking of 
merchant shipping grew to dangerous levels  
but the fact remained that now 
the initiative lay with the allies   in january faced with the losses the battle of the 
atlantic was made top priority in the strategic  
planning and all effort directed into the u-boat 
war special long-range aircraft were deployed  
aircraft carriers now introduced to escort 
groups the battle of the atlantic had been  
a grim long slar now the american and british 
navies forced a decisive battle making the dark  
calculation that the loss of two merchant ships 
for each u-boat would break the german navy by may  
although shipping losses had reached their highest 
ever more than 100 german submarines and their  
crews had been lost the u-boats were withdrawn it 
was another allied victory no less crucial than  
stalingrad or midway the struggle at sea was 
part of the war of resources and production  
the struggle between the economies between 
the factories of the axis and the allies   it was a struggle won by britain 
and america and their allies  
particularly canada who had mobilized earlier 
and utilized their economies better than the axis  
mobilizing the skills and talents of women and 
extracting every scrap of effort and ingenuity to  
make more and better materials of war and release 
as many men as possible for the armed forces
america did not use coercion to provide the 
workforce neither men nor women were conscripted  
the energy and programs of the new deal were 
continued vast migrations of population moved  
across the united states lured by war work the 
british economy over mobilized and had to recall  
men from uniform the direction of the individual's 
life in the wartime economy was complete  
ten percent of britain's conscripts were sent 
to the coal mines not the forces maintaining  
the effort in the war factories where long 
hours were endured once the threat of immediate  
invasion or defeat had passed was difficult high 
wages and natural patriotism were not enough  
and war workers in all countries were the 
targets of extensive propaganda campaigns  
in america the famous character of rosie 
the riveter was created to motivate women  
workers in britain general montgomery toured 
factories using his own individual brand of  
charisma to motivate the workforce if the 
battlefront and the home fight rarely get  
down to it this year we can get the thing almost 
finished that next year we just talked with her
[Applause] it is to buy into the mythology of world war ii   to assume that the factories were 
full of happy and contented workers  
there were strikes in minds and factories 
of britain despite their illegality [Music]
the industrial war was not simply a war 
of quantity it was also a war of quality  
the allies and the axis competed to equip 
their armed forces with better weapons  
the secret weapon the new weapon features large 
in the fiction of the war science and technology  
did play a great part in the fighting in march 
1943 in a battle of this high technology war  
the british royal air force mounted its famous 
dam buster raid using a revolutionary bomb that  
bounced on the surface of water the raf attacked 
the three dams in germany's industrial region  
the attack required great bravery and skill of the 
pilots to fly a big high altitude strategic bomber  
the lancaster at low level history merges 
with myth in the dam buster story the raid  
cannot be counted a success although there 
was much flooding industry was hardly affected  
and the dams soon repaired the secret weapon 
the bouncing bomb was never used again
many of the innovations were far 
less dramatic but had greater impact   allied fighter pilots in air-to-air combat 
enjoyed the advantages of the proximity fuse  
a wartime invention a miniature radar would 
explode shells as they neared the enemy aircraft  
science contributed in many ways scientists 
and mathematicians created the new discipline  
of operational research into the way military 
operations were conducted the optimum search  
pattern used by an aircraft hunting a u-boat 
would be the product of scientific calculation
much of this work remained intensely secret 
unseen by the civilian and the ordinary soldier  
in march 1943 the greatest secret still remained 
very deep their full meaning known to but a few  
the war of technology though was 
not one-sided germany had its own   scientists and in the months to come britain 
would feel the impact of nazi secret weapons
the dam buster raid was an exception to the raf's 
usual tactics and using the lancaster throughout  
1943 the intensity of the british air force's 
nighttime attacks grew ever greater the british  
planes flew high at night and used area bombing 
their targets were not individual buildings or  
places but entire cities or towns effectively 
the bombs were aimed at the civilian population  
in late july 1943 more than 3 000 raf bombers 
attacked the city of hamburg and caused the  
first man-made firestorm the intensity of 
bombing plus natural weather conditions  
caused thousands of small fires to merge 
into one giant inferno a huge fireball  
sat upon the city it sucked in air at such 
speed that hurricane-force winds were created  
and temperatures raised to at least 800 degrees 
celsius across an area of 22 square kilometers  
45 000 people were incinerated or simply 
asphyxiated in this one single attack  
to place these deaths in a grim context   in the whole six years of war german attacks on 
britain killed just over sixty thousand [Music]
civilians [Music]
the united states air force mounted massive 
daylight raids aiming to make precisely targeted  
attacks upon targets of strategic importance the 
us air force had practiced these surgical strikes  
against french targets in these attacks they 
operated under the cover of friendly fighters  
in spring 1943 the usaf left its escorts 
behind and attacked targets deep in germany  
the crews of both american and british bombers 
needed courage there were few more dangerous jobs  
in any regular armed forces nearly half of the 
young men who flew these missions never came home  
german air defenses became ever more efficient 
with radar-guided anti-aircraft fire the luftwaffe  
perfected night fighter tactics and the german 
fighters were as deadly to unescorted bombers in  
daylight as had the spitfires and hurricanes 
of the raf been in the battle of britain
the losses of the attacking 
aircraft were extremely high  
when in the autumn of 1943 the raf began 
to attack berlin over a period of five  
months it lost more than half its total 
strength attacking just that one city  
losses on the american side were equally as bad 
and in the end the bombers had to be withdrawn
it was only the vast industrial effort that 
sustained the two air forces in their attacks  
the strategic bomber offensive consumed perhaps 
half of the entire british war expenditure  
it has been convincingly argued that in 1943 the 
strategic air offensive cost america and britain  
more than was gained by the attacks 
on germany after the terrible hamburg  
firestorm production in the city was back at 
eighty percent of normal in just five months  
during and since the war debate has 
raged about both the military value   and the absolute morality of strategic bomber 
offensives even during the war the rights and  
wrongs of these attacks on civilian targets caused 
disagreement which persists to this day to many  
the architect of british area bombing strategy air 
marshal arthur harris is classed as a war criminal
in the context of the war the deaths of 
perhaps as many as one million german   civilians to these attacks have to be 
weighed against millions of other losses
germany's major effort in the 
war was focused in the east   the defeated stalingrad in january 1943 had 
left hitler shaken and fearful of decisions  
and it left the soviet forces temporarily 
exhausted russian offensives to follow up  
the stalingrad's success failed and were 
thrown back easily by the germans [Music]  
the german command knew that if victory were ever 
to be won an offensive must be quickly mounted  
before new soviet reinforcements could be brought 
to bear a plan was devised to attack and destroy  
the soviet forces at course where a large salient 
protruded from the line dividing the two armies  
this would be germany's last chance to win 
the war in the east the soviets realizing  
attack was imminent poured resources 
into the area creating massive defenses  
huge numbers of russian artillery sat in prepared 
positions on july 5th 1943 the germans attacked  
the battle of kursk remains the largest tank 
battle in history four thousand russian tanks  
met three thousand german machines for ten days 
a battle the like of which none had seen before  
raged the tanks engaged in a near continuous 
melee individual tank versus individual tank  
the germans nearly won but their losses were 
too great nazi strength was exhausted the german  
tank strength was cut to less than a quarter 
the last offensive ended in failure with the  
destruction of the entire german reserve 
tank force after kursk the german forces  
could never again take the initiative the losses 
were so great they could never again be made up
hitler ordered that the german army retreat   behind a specially constructed line of defenses 
to be called the east wall and hold that line
resources though had not been 
available for its construction   and for its most part the east wall 
remained a line on the map the russian  
forces paid heavily for their victories in the 
expenditure of both material and human life yet  
in sharp contrast to the nazis the numerical 
strength of the soviet forces continued to grow  
drawing on the vast reserves of the 
huge soviet population in the country  
following the summer the soviet army paused 
to regroup and plan for an offensive in the  
winter under conditions that naturally favored the 
russian soldier as the first frosts of the winter  
fell in october and november the russian army 
began attacks across the whole length of the front  
the initiative lay with the soviets their 
vast material advantage over the germans  
enabled the red army to strike where it desired 
where the nazi enemy's strength was at its weakest  
in the coming months the russian army 
would deal alternating blows as a boxer   throwing punches to the left and then the right 
constantly hammering the opponent into retreat
the german army fought a determined defensive 
battle obeying hitler's command stoutly  
refusing to give ground through this strategy 
german unit after german unit became caught  
in dangerous positions exposed to attack 
on three sides in terrain that offered no  
easy way out or even actually surrounded in vast 
pockets of men and arms hitler was persuaded  
in january 1944 to retreat and in a series of 
battles the endangered forces were pulled out  
in the north of russia the narrow corridor of 
territory which had connected the besieged city   of leningrad was widened and the blockade of the 
city finally lifted with german forces driven back  
by early 1944 the soviet union had recaptured 
strategically important regions of the ukraine  
russian forces had even reached the 1939 eastern 
border of poland in the face of the seemingly  
endless growth of soviet strength hitler's 
generals appealed to the dictator for reserves  
they were told that invasion was imminent in 
france and no strength could be spared [Music]
in the summer of 1943 when the battle of kursk 
was at its height hitler had been distracted  
by yet another challenge from the allies on july 
10th the american forces under george s patton and  
british troops commanded by bernard montgomery 
landed in sicily the aim of the attack was to  
surround germany with pressure on all sides and 
force hitler to draw strength away from russia  
the americans were unconvinced about the landing 
they believed it another of churchill's wild  
indirect strategies and thought the attack 
should instead be made in northern europe  
yet that attack could not yet be mounted 
and powerful arguments were made that forces  
flushed with victory and battle 
experience in north africa   would be ill-used if sent back to britain to sit 
in camps awaiting fresh action needless to say  
this last was a judgment of high command not 
the soldier on the ground [Laughter] [Music]
the invasion of sicily was to a pattern 
repeated in the latter years of the war a  
deception had been perpetrated in the germans 
a dead body was placed by a british submarine  
a supposed victim of a plane crash the dead man 
carried papers which said that the preparations  
aimed at sicily were a ruse that the real target 
was greece the germans were fooled the pattern  
of closely coordinated attacks by the army's 
air forces and navies of different countries  
meant that the british and american 
forces landed against only weak [Music]
opposition the terrain of italy was easily 
defended and made the use of armor difficult the  
italian forces fought weakly and half-heartedly 
but german forces made stiff resistance
[Music] using seaborn force to outflank successive german 
lines of defense the germans were driven back and  
evacuated the island by the end of july the 
capture of sicily brought little military  
advantage the german forces drawn into the 
campaign were not in the main taken from russia  
the allied lines of communication to the middle 
east which sicily threatened were already secure
yet the invasion did bring about dramatic 
political change in italy the italian high  
command who had never truly accepted mussolini 
and fascism were convinced by the failure of the  
italian forces that italy should change sides on 
july 25th mussolini was arrested and imprisoned  
and the new italian government immediately 
entered secret negotiations with the allies
in early september british forces 
landed at calabria in the toe of italy  
a few days later on september 8th 
the italian government surrendered   the germans had anticipated this and the axis 
ally rapidly became an axis occupied country  
the next day a combined british and american 
force landed at salerno south of naples the  
aim of the two landings was to capture southern 
italy in a giant pincer movement the experience  
of the two halves to this operation stand 
in sharp contrast the southern landing  
went unopposed and scarcely can be called 
an invasion in the north disaster threatened  
the beaches were overlooked by high ground 
on all sides extremely well organized german  
counter-attacks held the first troops on the 
landing grounds while powerful reinforcements were  
hurried to the battle the german forces were built 
up quicker than those of the allies the airfields  
that the allies captured and intended to use for 
reinforcements were kept under fire by the germans  
new weapons the earliest guided missiles were 
used by the nazis to attack warships supporting  
the invaders within days the americans and british 
were in a desperate position and plans were being  
made for evacuation to save the situation u.s 
paratroopers were dropped onto the beach hand  
naval warships hurried extra troops from egypt 
extra battleships of the royal navy were brought  
to bear and the british raf in the mediterranean 
abandoned strategic bombing and brought its heavy  
bombers to bear in tactical ground support 
eventually the other half of the allied  
forces coming from the south joined up and simple 
weight of numbers made the german forces withdraw  
to form a new defensive position to the north 
while the fighting at salerno was at its height  
german special forces made a daring raid 
and rescued mussolini from his captivity  
the italian dictator was installed by the germans 
as the dictator of a tiny fascist puppet state  
in the north of italy the comparative success 
of the germans at salerno convinced hitler  
that the italian campaign should be fought 
in a spirit of complete defiance that not  
a centimeter of ground should be yielded the 
campaign was to become a long drag of attrition  
to be fought up the entire length of the 
italian peninsula the allied armies were  
forced to make frontal assault after frontal 
assault against prepared german positions  
wider demands on allied resources meant that 
the british and american armies were matched   numerically by the germans only in air 
power did the allies have an advantage  
the german troops were of the highest quality 
their defensive positions dug in place   in steep rocky hillsides were not easy 
targets for the air forces the germans  
had only to defend shortages of fuel did not 
affect troops which had no need to maneuver  
the italian campaign saw the greatest involvement 
in world war ii by south american forces  
brazil had declared war upon germany in response 
to the intense provocation of repeated u-boat  
attacks upon brazilian shipping 25 000 brazilian 
troops took part in the fighting in italy [Music]  
the fighting in italy has been described as 
that part of world war ii which most came to  
resemble the first world war where attackers 
were forced to make assault after assault  
against fixed lines of defenders with vast 
expenditure of life for tiny gains of territory  
if there was a battle that was the equivalent of 
the western front it is the battle of monte casino  
the german army held a tall hill atop which set a 
medieval monastery the hill dominated the entire  
line separating the armies it was a position that 
controlled the whole front no progress could be  
made unless the allies took the hill that the 
germans had made into a fortress between january  
and may 1944 a series of battles were fought to 
take casinos ever heavier bombardments were piled  
upon the town and hill that created ruins that 
made the defenders task even easier a succession  
of commanders poured more and more troops in 
a succession of attacks that appeared to grow  
increasingly fruitless bad weather compounded 
the difficulties of the attackers soldiers  
who had fought in both battles said the terrain 
resembled that of the battle of the sun [Music]  
to the north of casino the allies made an 
attempt to break this deadlock at anzio  
on the coast another combined amphibious landing 
was made it would threaten the germans at casino  
it could threaten to attack rome and capture the 
italian capital this attack ii became bogged down  
against determined german attacks that were 
both well planned and skillfully improvised  
by some of germany's better troops the germans 
forced the allies to reverse their strategy  
attacks had to be redoubled upon casino 
to relieve the pressure at anzio [Music]
the spring of 1944 saw a dramatic change 
in the war in the air in response to the  
heavy losses inflicted by the fighters of 
the luftwaffe the united states army air   force brought a new weapon into play 
the p-51 mustang long-range fighter
the british royal air force held that any fighter 
capable of making the mission deep into germany  
alongside the bombers would not in effect be a 
fighter the weight of fuel such a craft would  
have to carry would make it impossible to obtain 
a performance to match that of germany's excellent
fighters
the mustang owed its extended range to the 
simple invention of the underwing drop tank  
made of cardboard which could carry the extra fuel 
to extend the aircraft's range and then be dropped  
to improve performance the new fighters were not 
simply long range they were also of a superior  
design as fighting machines that could match any 
fighter that the luftwaffe could put into the sky  
as 1943 turned into 1944 the united states army 
air force began a bombing campaign which was  
in the end to prove decisive the bombers were 
now used to draw up the defending fighters  
that were engaged by the mustangs now the war 
of numbers the war fought in the factories  
of industrial might began to tell against the 
germans the americans were able to slowly and  
systematically destroy the luftwaffe's fighter 
force plane by plane pilot by pilot in february  
mass attacks by the long-range fighters 
were coupled with bombing raids by both   raf and us air forces aimed at german fighter 
production factories were targeted for the full  
weight of the allied air forces plane by plane 
pilot by pilot the german air force was destroyed  
as its strength grew weaker the 
task of those pilots that remained   grew more difficult it became easier for the usa 
to make daylight raids easier for the raf at night
in the late autumn of 1943 for the first time all 
three leaders of the allies met together at tehran  
in iran britain and america agreed that 
the invasion of france would go ahead  
in the following year accompanied 
by landings in the south of france  
stalin agreed that the soviet union would 
mount an offensive in the east at the same time  
there was an unwritten and highly secret agreement 
that once the war against germany had been won  
the soviet union would attack japan nowhere in the 
world could the axis forces take the initiative  
nowhere could they carry war to their enemy 
axis strategists were helpless to counter  
allied attacks bereft of inspiration that 
would counter the moves of their opponents  
everywhere the axis soldier waited behind defenses 
scanning the horizon for the signs of attack  
everywhere the axis civilian lived in fear 
in the spring of 1944 the warring world  
knew the end game of the fight was about to 
begin a year before the allies at the casablanca  
conference had spelled out their war aim as 
the unconditional surrender of the axis forces  
now they prepared to take the final steps that 
would destroy their enemy time on world war ii the  
complete history the deadlock breaks at the battle 
of monte casino and rome falls to the allies
as rome is liberated the great invasion of 
northwestern europe begins on d-day with operation  
overlord the greatest amphibious operation in 
the history of warfare sees allied armies swarm  
ashore the coast of normandy simultaneously 
american armies land in southern france
by the end of the summer free 
french leader charles de gaulle   leads a victorious entry into paris
swamped by the force of numbers the 
nazis respond with secret weapons   using technology that belongs to the future 
the first cruise missile the v1 appears in  
the skies of england then more deadly the first 
ballistic missile the v-2 brings death to london  
the british government at first denies 
that a new weapon has been unleashed

attempting to shorten the war 
british general montgomery   commits his airborne forces too far with 
attacks upon rhine crossings at arnhem  
the result is disaster and the war 
continues into yet another year
[Music] so
[Music] in the spring of 1944 the world awaits the attack 
of the allied forces in northern europe the  
opening of the much awaited second front in italy 
an earlier attempt at a second front has halted  
against fierce german resistance in russia the 
germans have fought their last offensive an attack  
that crashes to failure at the battle of kursk the 
end of the blitzkrieg as a menace is mirrored by  
the end of the german u-boat threat as the german 
navy is defeated in the battle of the atlantic  
as the end game begins the axis leadership can 
now only act to postpone its inevitable doom
[Music] the previous autumn the italian advance of the 
allies had stopped before the town and hill of  
monte casino in the spring of 1944 four battles 
were to be fought in an attempt to take the town  
that dominated the front and prevented any move 
north first u.s forces were repelled at high  
cost by the germans then indian and new zealand 
troops assisted by heavy strategic bombers made  
two attempts to take casino both times defeated 
with heavy losses by the april of 1944 the italian  
campaign had reached crisis the success of the 
germans was giving hitler hope the battles seem to  
prove that german arms could deny both the greater 
numbers and material strength of the allies  
both american and british generals admitted 
themselves bereft of ideas the position  
was finally priced open by fresh minds three 
french troops drawn from moroccan hill tribes  
found ways through mountains thought impassable 
and encircled casinos free polish troops  
made a near suicidal attack from the south casino 
fell and the italian front opened for movement
in the release from the frustration that the 
fight for casino had generated clear military  
judgment became clouded by ambition and lust 
for glory as the germans retreated from casino  
american armies could have overtaken and encircled 
their enemy perhaps ending the war in italy  
instead us general mark clark an officer 
who felt the failure at casino personally  
and suspected the british of attempting 
to steal the glory of victory   ordered an advance on rome and the 
germans fled northwards in safety
on june 4th american forces entered rome in 
triumph meanwhile german engineers were preparing  
a new complex line of fortifications against which 
the battle would have to be fought all over again
soon the glory of the capture of the italian 
capital would be overshadowed by greater events
as casino fell in the pacific 
u.s forces for the first time   occupied japanese territory the marshall islands 
were a remote group of 36 micronesian atolls  
forming part of the outer 
perimeter of japanese defenses   in a brilliantly planned and executed attack 
which used intelligence derived from broken coded  
signals which enabled the us forces to find the 
weakest points in the japanese fortifications the  
islands were taken over by 80 000 troops in the 
spring of 1944 fighting continued in the struggle  
along the borders of burma india and china 
british empire forces were on the defensive  
against renewed japanese attacks based on the 
adage that attack is the best form of defense  
the japanese had mounted an offensive to preempt 
a british and u.s invasion 85 000 japanese troops  
attempted to take the remote towns of impal 
and kohima towns that were effective gateways  
into india the british empire troops were ordered 
to resist with no retreat or surrender and  
were besieged the british supplied their troops 
by air the japanese not at all and their troops  
began to suffer from starvation and disease 
the british troops defied japanese attack  
after japanese attack for 80 days with 
increasing desperation on both sides
in late june the japanese were forced to withdraw   only a quarter of their troops had survived the 
british began preparations to pursue their enemy
for nearly four years western europe 
had suffered german occupation   however it was clear to the world that this era 
of history was ending all over southern england  
the signs were that the invasion was coming a 
massive assembly of men and material was gathering  
the allies aimed to bring an overwhelming 
strength to bear against the germans
the invasion was given a secret 
code name operation overlord
the coast of britain to a depth of 16 kilometers 
became a secret forbidden military zone villages  
evacuated of civilians countryside and 
coast requisitioned by the military  
as armed forces practiced and practiced 
again the skills of amphibious warfare
britain itself was sealed 
all foreign travel forbidden  
the invasion was the product of lessons 
learned in many previous operations where  
the army's air forces and navies of different 
nations cooperated in detailed coordinated
action
at the top of the organization was united states 
general dwight d eisenhower eisenhower's abilities  
were political as much as military making 
the alliance work in everyday reality  
if it is true that every battle is won or 
lost before it's fought then the leadership  
of the staff that eisenhower assembled is the 
embodiment of that idea there was meticulous  
attention to detail and a refusal to act without 
the correct preparation and resources for victory  
the actual military plans were in the hands of 
bernard montgomery the master of the set peace  
battle with a fanatical obsession for detail 
[Music] eisenhower's diplomacy was crucial  
in his winning command of both british 
and american strategic bomber air forces  
the air force commanders believed their attacks 
on german industry and cities could win the war  
on their own and resisted their planes 
being used in the support of ground forces  
events would show eisenhower right
it's hard for us to realize that armies fighting 
on beaches fighting their way ashore with  
specialist equipment was a new thing historically 
amphibious landings were made by ordinary ships  
ordinary boats by small armies the size of armies 
the lack of radar of aircraft of the telephone  
meant amphibious landings were made unopposed the 
lessons of previous invasions in north africa and  
italy brought forth new technologies of war 
swimming tanks were designed to fight with the  
very first wave of attacks provided with flotation 
tanks and propellers the tanks were launched  
at sea and swam ashore to suppress fire from 
defending infantry specialist fighting vehicles  
cleared mines laid roads and bridged obstacles 
it was an eccentric area in which the british
excelled the allies preparations and rehearsals 
though could not be hidden it was not hard for the  
germans to guess which beaches could be targeted 
for landing it was obvious that the invasion would  
be mounted within the range of fighter cover from 
planes flying from england it was not difficult to  
determine when time tide and weather would be 
right two broad strategic options lay open to  
the allies first to attack across the english 
channel at its narrowest to land near calais  
this would be an obvious move once established 
allied forces would have a short thrust  
into southern germany the alternative would 
be to attack in normandy further to the west
the allied forces mounted a complex campaign 
of deception aimed at fooling the germans  
into thinking that an invasion was to fall on cali 
when in fact the attack was to be made in normandy  
a phony military formation was created the first 
u.s army group this imaginary unit was based  
opposite cali the germans were able to listen 
into signals passed between fictional units  
vast arsenals of weaponry could be spied by german 
reconnaissance inflatable tanks and dummy aircraft  
all germany's spies in britain had been caught and 
turned and were feeding fake intelligence to their  
spy masters [Music] air power was central 
to the success of overlord in the italian  
campaign at salerno and anzio well-organized 
german troops had quickly brought up reserves  
against allied amphibious landings the first 
days and weeks of the invasion would be a race  
between the two armies to bring reinforcements 
into action air power was crucial to the allies  
winning that race attacking the roads the 
railways and the bridges the german army would use  
in april and may 1944 more than 11 000 aircraft of 
all types flew 200 000 sorties against targets in  
france communications airfields military 
bases coastal guns and radar stations  
the railway system of northern 
france was almost entirely destroyed
the air forces were important in the deception too 
three times as many bombs were dropped in the east  
aimed at the calais region as were dropped 
near to the true normandy target the luftwaffe  
was entirely overwhelmed it had a mere 300 
aircraft to match 11 000 of the allies [Music]  
the disruption wrought by the allied air forces 
was complemented by the actions of the french   resistance the armed resistance the maquis was 
not strong enough to take on the german army  
but through acts of sabotage and diversionary 
attacks they disrupted german communications  
preventing the rapid reaction that could 
have halted the invasion on the beaches
[Music]   the number of ships involved on june 
6th is stupefying to the imagination
6483 vessels were to cross the channel so 
large a fleet that had calais been chosen  
there was not enough sea room for such a fleet 
where the channel was at its narrowest the fleet  
included 4 000 landing craft and hundreds of 
specially adapted transport ships and stretched  
from horizon to horizon in every direction 
seven battleships 23 cruisers and more than  
100 destroyers accompanied the troop transports on 
d-day these ships engaged the german coastal guns  
germany had but four destroyers and 39 motor 
torpedo boats germany's plans to resist  
invasion were no less detailed allied troops were 
to be met on the beaches by a formidable line of  
bunkers and coastal guns the atlantic wall 
the defenses were organized by erwin rummel  
he intended any invader to be pinned down on 
the landing beaches by what were called the  
static divisions manning the forts and then hit 
by a mobile reserve of panzer forces held inland  
the germans stripped the french 
national line to build the atlantic wall   they laid millions of mines and devised cunning 
traps and obstacles for landing craft and tanks  
the destruction of the coastal defenses by 
the warships needed daylight the landing  
craft needed low water early in the morning 
and the airborne attacks to be made at night  
needed the full moon this narrowed 
the date for d-day to the 5th  
6th or 7th of june bad weather on the 
5th caused the attack to be put back 24
hours the first forces to land in france 
did not storm ashore from landing craft  
rather they arrived in the early 
hours of the morning of the sixth   landings were made by over 23 000 parachute and 
glider troops the airborne landings were made on  
the flanks of the invasion zone to protect the 
beaches from counter-attack whilst the seaborne  
forces established a bridge hand the ground 
forces were delivered to five landing beaches  
in the east two areas codenamed utah and omaha 
were the responsibility of the american forces  
the experience of fighting on the two beaches 
was very different on utah beach in the far west  
the american forces met perhaps 
the weakest of german troops   three battalions of inventory defending the 
beaches surrendered without firing barely a shot  
the utah casualties of 197 were the lowest of any 
on the day of the invasion in comparison to the  
twenty three thousand who came safely ashore 
in contrast the u s forces landing on omaha  
underwent the very worst of ordeals endured by 
any troops on june 6. the u.s first division  
came ashore to be met by perhaps the very best 
troops that the germans had stationed on the coast  
the american soldiers landed on beaches overlooked 
by cliffs beaches onto which the germans were able  
to direct murderous artillery fire at omaha 
the swimming tanks were launched too soon  
and many foundered in heavy seas without the 
support of these tanks the infantry on the beach  
was vulnerable to german infantry in fortified 
positions omaha beach has been called a disaster  
and portrayed in fiction as hell yet despite 2 
000 deaths on the first day 34 000 came ashore
british forces attacked to the east 
on beaches code named gold and sword  
on juno beach the invaders were canadian   on all three landing zones the german defenders 
were not the best and were thinly spread  
on sword and juno the landings were made easily 
against little opposition before midday on june  
6th the troops were able to join up with the 
airborne forces dropped in the rear of the germans  
overlord was a complex operation dependent upon 
every element playing its part on gold beach  
a failure of the naval bombardment to suppress 
all german fortifications and the swimming  
tanks becoming separated from the infantry 
meant that the british took heavy casualties  
nevertheless the story of 
other beaches was repeated   and despite losses the invaders were able 
to land and penetrate into the countryside  
an important lesson of the fighting in italy was 
the need to maintain a safe and plentiful line of  
supply the allies needed to bring supplies and 
reinforcements ashore faster than the germans  
could move the same over land by road and rail the 
overlord plan involved capturing the french port  
of cherbourg but two technologies were developed 
that enabled the allies to have a secure supply  
allied civil engineering became as inventive 
as any work in radar or electronics  
a floating harbor system was built out of concrete   code named mulberry and weighing a million 
and a half tonnes the harbors were floated  
across the channel in parts and then sunk 
into place to provide an instant port
later in the campaign a flexible oil supply pipe 
was laid under the sea to deliver a constant flow  
of fuel in the three weeks following the invasion 
the allies moved more than eight hundred thousand  
troops across the channel they joined all the 
beach heads together and captured the port of  
cherbourg yet the invasion fell behind schedule 
the territory held by the allies was too small to  
hold the troops that had been transported 
not enough airfields had been captured  
germans skilled in anti-tank and defensive warfare 
were defending stoutly in the countryside that the  
french called bokage bokaze was a medieval 
field system over hundreds of years thick  
hedgerows had grown to create deep sunken 
lanes that provided the germans with row  
after row of ready-made deep trench lines 
ready-made defenses that could stop tanks  
the same roads forced attackers into vulnerable 
single file traps with no room for maneuver  
the norman town of car was a d-day objective three 
weeks after d-day it was still german held as  
long as the nazis held the town they denied access 
into the countryside to the south where the bokage  
ended and tanks could maneuver with freedom it was 
countryside where airfields could be built [Music]  
repeatedly british and canadian soldiers 
threw themselves against khan only to be  
repulsed british general montgomery took the 
ruthless decision to call in the heavy bombers  
of the strategic air forces was to be 
liberated by being bombed into ruins  
on july 7th the royal air force and united states 
army air force systematically demolished khan
[Music] in the next week the british 
and american armies fought   a series of fierce battles as they pushed 
the perimeter of the beachhead ever south
[Music] repeatedly the strategic bombers carpet 
bombed german positions by mid-july  
the british have lost more than 
one-third of their total tank force
the american army in the west 
following extensive copper bombing   finally broke through their push to the 
south opened the war and broke the stalemate  
the attack that developed turned around the german 
flank and began to surround their normandy armies  
hitler had ordered a counter-attack in early 
august that threatened to cut off and surround  
the americans again the great secret of 
the broken german codes came into play  
the allies were ready and waiting and the 
germans were defeated with heavy losses  
the tank came of age in world war ii the decisive 
and devastating attacks of the 1940 german  
blitzkrieg had demonstrated the potency of armored 
warfare yet to every invention there is a reaction  
and during the war powerful techniques and 
weapons of anti-tank warfare had been devised  
the armies fighting in 1944 were 
far different from those of 1940  
no longer did infantry simply 
flee before advancing tanks   as they had in 1940 tanks were still an essential 
ingredient for victory but needed the support  
of specialized infantry and mobile artillery to 
counter the anti-tank regiments of their enemy
the allies rolled the germans into an ever 
tighter pocket around the french town of fillets  
by the middle of august nearly half a million 
germans were in an ever more tightly closing trap  
attackers on all sides to their rear 
the obstacle of the river saints  
in what came to be called the battle of the filets 
gap determined action by the ss hitler youth  
division a formation of fanatics recruited 
entirely from the nazi youth organization  
held back the allies while three hundred thousand 
germans streamed across the river seine in a mass  
escape all german heavy equipment was lost 1300 
tanks destroyed and 200 000 taken prisoner [Music]  
the original overlord plan intended the allies to 
halt at the same to regroup and reorganize instead  
eisenhower decided to capitalize on the victory 
one and ordered pursuit of the germans across the  
open country of france hitler had not allowed the 
preparation of any fallback defensive positions  
there was nowhere to hide nowhere to stand 
and fight the germans had to run all the  
way to belgium and the netherlands 
even to the borders of germany itself  
hitler's strategic common sense had not entirely 
deserted him realizing that long lines of supply  
would weaken the allies he commanded all channel 
ports garrisoned by stay behind forces to be  
turned into fortresses and defended to the last as 
the allies neared the borders of the low countries  
in early september few thought the war would 
last into 1945. [Music] in mid-august 1944 as  
the normandy battles were reaching their height 
the allies mounted a second invasion of france on  
the riviera originally planned to be simultaneous 
with the normandy attack a shortage of landing  
craft caused the southern invasion to be delayed 
again there was a massive naval bombardment  
and once again the allies enjoyed massive air 
superiority with 2 000 planes against 200 german  
once initial resistance had been broken the 
task of the american and free french armies  
was of pursuit and entrapment of the constantly 
retreating germans the riviera landings threatened  
to confound hitler's plan that paris should be 
turned into a fortress and battleground hitler  
talked of the french capital as a stalingrad that 
would entrap the allied armies and lead to their  
annihilation enduring the same fate as befell 
the german army at the russian city a year before  
the riviera landings threatened to surround paris 
and instead make the city a trap for the germans  
on august 18th when it became apparent that the 
allied armies were threatening to overwhelm the  
occupiers the population of paris rose in revolt 
and fighting broke out on the streets eisenhower  
and montgomery refused to attack for the sake of 
attacking they too saw the lesson of stalingrad  
they ruthlessly believed that liberation could 
wait and only military necessity justified attack  
as it became clear that the 
city was fighting to free itself   the allies were forced to act leader of the 
free french charles de gaulle feared that french  
communists were attempting a takeover and using 
the fighting to eliminate their rivals for power  
in post-war france the allies agreed 
that free french forces could be released  
and on august 23rd their tanks entered 
paris the german command surrendered
de gaulle led allied forces in a march of 
triumph down the champs-elysees [Music]  
in the complicated timeline of world war ii it's 
possible that the smallest of human actions might  
have ended the war and saved many hundreds of 
thousands of lives on july 20th there was an  
assassination attempt upon hitler an officer on 
hitler's staff klaus von staffenberg a german  
patriot and war hero planted a bomb in a meeting 
attended by the dictator fortune was at hitler's  
side that day the meeting changed location to a 
building that minimized the effect of the blast  
another officer just wanting to get a closer 
look at a map moved the bomb behind a heavy table  
hitler had moved from his usual place in the 
room though three died hitler survived unhurt  
and came to believe that his survival was 
the portent of a greater historical destiny  
the group of soldiers and civil servants that had 
hatched the plot were arrested and sadistically  
executed the plotters included erwin rummel who 
was told to commit suicide or his family would  
be sent to concentration camps [Music] so the war 
continued and hitler came to believe in miracles
the allies enjoyed the results 
of many new technologies   new weapons and new scientific ways of waging 
war this war of invention was not one-sided  
germany was one of the world's leading 
scientific nations and the german armed   forces enjoyed the use of futuristic weaponry as 
the allied armies fought to establish their grip  
upon northern france one of the most famous 
products of german ingenuity made its debut  
on june 13th the first v1 flying bomb was launched 
against london the v1 was the prototype cruise  
missile a pilotless jet aircraft with automatic 
guidance that was both ground and air launched  
in the next two weeks nearly two and a half 
thousand of these missiles were fired the  
flying bombs brought the return of terror to 
london worse than the conventional air raid  
as attacks were constant there was no 
warning no all clear no release of tension
as in 1939 children and the vulnerable were 
evacuated some of the missiles were destroyed  
by anti-aircraft artillery the fastest of fighters 
could catch and shoot down the v-1 but this needed  
courage from the pilot as the missile exploding 
frequently destroyed the attacking fighter some  
spitfire pilots developed a daring technique 
of flying alongside the v1 wing to wing and  
then placing a wing beneath that of the v1 tipping 
the missile into a tumbling dive in september 1944  
mysterious and massive explosions began to occur 
all over the british capital a thunder clap of  
destruction would be followed by a roaring noise 
that shocked and dazed survivors likened to that  
of a speeding train the explosions were attacks by 
a new german secret weapon the v2 the v2 was the  
first ballistic missile the roar that followed the 
explosion was the sound of the supersonic missile  
arriving after the destination the government hid 
the truth official news talked of gas explosions  
it was two months after the first v2 attack that 
the government admitted the new weapon existed  
there was no defense against the v-2 the missile 
took less than three minutes to fly to britain
[Music]   in the pacific the gradual process of erosion 
of driving back the japanese island by island  
continued in june 1944 yet more amphibious 
assaults began this time in the marianas islands  
the islands were important to both attacker 
and defender the first target saipan was an  
important japanese base and within strategic 
bomber range of the japanese home islands  
the second u.s objective guam held 
important supplies of fresh water  
and was the best natural harbor in the western 
pacific guam would also be a base for bomber  
attacks on japan and a starting point for 
attacks to recover the philippine islands
as so often in these invasions of pacific islands 
the battle on land was preceded by a naval battle  
the battle of the philippine sea turned 
into the largest carrier battle of the war  
the japanese were outnumbered in nearly every 
aspect the americans had more than twice the  
aircraft had seven major carriers to japan's 
five eight light carriers to japan's four  
disparity in quantity was matched by difference 
in quality after earlier battles japanese crews  
and pilots never regained the level of training 
and prowess they had enjoyed earlier in the war  
and came to be surpassed in skill by the americans 
the quality of american radar and intelligence  
was also superior a great air battle was fought 
in which the americans enjoyed such superiority  
that the fighting came to be called 
the great marianas turkey shoot  
the japanese lost nearly 
two-thirds of their planes
two japanese carriers were lost one 
to air attack one to a u.s submarine
with the naval threat destroyed us marines had to 
fight a stern battle to take saipan four thousand  
marine casualties were sustained in the first 
two days an invasion planned to last three days  
stretched to three weeks the terrain of saipan 
meant that the u.s soldiers were forced to make  
repeated frontal assaults against dug-in japanese 
the defenders fought with fanatical determination  
in july a mass suicide attack by the japanese saw 
more than 4 000 japanese troops killed in one day  
rather than surrender many japanese 
chose to die by their own hand
the delays caused in the taking of saipan   allowed both defenders and attackers 
of guam to make full preparations  
the americans opened the assault with the heaviest 
air and naval bombardments of the pacific war more  
than half the twenty thousand japanese defenders 
were killed before a single us marine landed
although guam was secured easily the 
remnants of the japanese forces fought on  
the last surrendered in 1972
as soon as the marianas were secure the us army 
air force began to turn the islands into bases to  
attack the japanese the raids were to be born 
on the wings of a new aircraft the b-29 super  
fortress the b-29 was a huge aircraft that could 
carry a heavier bomb load a greater range than  
any other aircraft at first the planes had flown 
a tortuous route from bases in china from where  
southern japan was just in range from november 
1944 the marianas had been turned into airbases  
the first raids had been precision high-level 
attacks upon the japanese aircraft industry  
the raids were inconclusive in the coming 
years these tactics were to be abandoned  
in favor of mass area attacks 
against japan's wooden cities
when ordered to retreat from the philippine 
islands in 1942 us general douglas macarthur  
had famously promised to return in late 1944 
he gathered the forces to fulfill his vow  
the japanese occupation forces in the philippines 
were ill-prepared to resist a u.s invasion
japan had entered the war in 1941 fully 
mobilized with as many men as possible in uniform  
and industry at near capacity the united 
states navy had imposed a tight blockade  
around the japanese islands that severely 
restricted japan's capacity to wage war  
in contrast the u.s navy enjoyed an embarrassment 
of riches able to draw from a well of near  
bottomless resources new battleships new cruisers 
new destroyers streamed from u.s shipyards of the  
most important ships in the war the aircraft 
carriers no less than 21 new major carriers  
had been launched since pearl harbor five times 
the equivalent number of japanese ships the total  
number of aircraft the americans could embark was 
three thousand three times the japanese strength
in september 1944 u.s carrier aircraft 
destroyed japanese air forces on the philippines  
in october macarthur assembled 
a fleet of over 700 ships   and following a huge bombardment by battleships 
u.s troops landed on the philippine island of late  
japan responded with the dispatch of a massive 
naval force the battle of late gulf as the  
battle was to be called remains the largest 
naval battle in world history the japanese  
plan was for their aircraft carriers to lure away 
the american carriers from the landings meanwhile  
a separate force of japanese battleships would 
attack the troop transports and the landed forces  
the battle of late gulf has been described 
as the last throw of the imperial japanese  
navy effectively every major warship that 
remained to japan was thrown into the gamble  
the last reserves of ships men and aircraft 
were deployed to effect a decisive battle
the battle was at the same time a carrier battle 
where the air forces of the two carrier fleets  
engaged each other and the enemy carriers and 
it was traditional battle fleet engagement  
where big gun battleships fought each other in 
duels of naval artillery the battle was complex  
as the two fleets divided their forces and 
searched for their enemy amongst the scattered   philippine islands admirals on both sides lost 
their nerve then found renewed determination
massive japanese battleships the 
largest in the world surprised   light us carriers which fought courageous 
actions against opponents many times their weight  
destroyers attacked each other or mounted 
audacious attacks on much heavier ships ships  
were lost by both sides of late but the fortune 
of war smiled on america and the result was a  
naval triumph which ranks as a victory alongside 
trafalgar as the us navy destroyed the japanese
all four japanese carriers and 
two of the battleships were sunk   japanese admiral nashimura went down with 
his ship with the naval battle resolved  
the fighting on land began macarthur spectacularly 
waded ashore before the newsreel cameras further  
in land seventy thousand japanese and fifteen 
thousand americans died in the battle to establish  
a bridgehead the japanese failed to throw back the 
invaders and a long battle for liberation began  
it was at late that a new word passed 
into the languages of the world   kamikaze a kamikaze attack was a suicide attack by 
a pilot crashing his plane loaded with explosive  
onto an enemy warship throughout the war in rage 
or fanatical desperation japanese aviators had  
crashed onto their enemies it was at late that 
the kamikaze attack became an official tactic  
the kamikaze drew on japanese mythology 
the word kamikaze meant divine wind  
and referred to a miraculous tempest that 
suddenly arose to destroy a chinese invasion fleet  
approaching the defenseless shores of medieval 
japan kamikaze attacks were not always by aircraft  
japan was to deploy [ __ ] submarines human 
piloted torpedoes and even small manned rockets  
in suicide attacks it was the converted fighter 
aircraft that were to be the most effective at  
late a u.s carrier and an australian cruiser 
were to be the first victims of the divine wind
hitler had seen the western invasion as the 
greatest threat endangering the very heart  
of the third reich on the eastern front he was 
prepared to concede territory and transferred  
troops to the west on june 22 1944 as the fighting 
in the west was at its height the soviet union  
launched a massive offensive that threatened a 
general collapse of the german armies in the east  
operation named after a hero of the wars 
against napoleon was a huge attack the numbers  
told heavily against the germans 1.2 million red 
army soldiers against four hundred thousand nazis  
five thousand two hundred tanks against nine 
hundred german machines six thousand soviet  
aircraft against thirteen hundred luftwaffe 
planes hitler was to sacrifice the lives of many  
thousands of his soldiers by designating soviet 
cities as fortresses to be held to the last man
in just five weeks the russian armies advanced 
nearly 750 kilometers by the end of july the red  
army was 20 kilometers from poland's capital 
warsaw as happened at paris the population of  
the polish capital with the sound of russian 
guns echoing over their city rose in revolt
the russians did nothing they 
drove attacks to the south   into the balkans fighting in bulgaria romania and 
hungary and north into the baltic states meanwhile  
the germans systematically destroyed 
warsaw and killed more than 200 000 poles
the russians were already looking forward to the 
post-war order the attacks to the north and south  
rather than towards berlin via warsaw were aimed 
at placing those states within the communist orbit  
the germans were allowed to destroy the poles 
to create a space that the soviets would fill
the war aim of the allies seems at first simple 
the destruction of nazism the rolling back of  
axis conquests the liberation of enslaved peoples 
already in late 1944 the signs were there to see  
that the post-war world would not be a 
place of simple straightforward certainty
in october 1944 a british army re-entered greece 
the occupation of greece had crumbled since the  
capitulation of the italians in late 1943 control 
had passed to the germans italian weapons had  
fallen into the hands of greek resistance fighters 
including the greek communist partisans the ellis  
the germans had resorted to ever more harsh 
reprisals to maintain their rule [Music]  
in october the germans took the 
decision to abandon greece and   the greek government returned 
with the help of british troops  
the british stepped into a minefield of 
passionate and violent politics in december  
a demonstration in athens by greek communists 
turned into fighting as they were opposed by  
supporters of the returned government in days the 
british army was fighting ellis in the streets
in the autumn of 1944 the optimism among the 
allies at the end of the normandy campaign  
that the war would soon be 
over was to prove misplaced   the advance across northern france had 
been so rapid that by early september  
the belgian capital of brussels had been 
liberated and the port of antwerp captured  
supply was crucial to the continuation of the 
war on into germany the capture of a major  
port facility was a major prize for the allied 
armies but was a prize that was to be squandered  
hitler ordered all channel 
ports to be held to the last man   dunkirk was to hold out to the very end of the war 
[Music] the capture of antwerp left a large german  
force to the west controlling the approaches to 
the port rendering it unusable the allies failed  
to clear those troops who mined and dominated the 
river with artillery the allies failed to prevent  
the germans from gathering their scattered forces 
and reorganizing the allies ignored intelligence  
that revealed their plan to fight a major battle 
against the allied supply lines no action was  
taken because of the wave of feverish optimism 
that the war could be ended quickly the will of  
the allied commanders was focused elsewhere the 
distraction was the operation planned by british  
general bernard montgomery to seize a crossing of 
the river rhine by airborne attack drive forward  
to the captured crossings with armored forces 
then invade germany and end the war before  
christmas this was the famous arnhem attack the 
bridge too far in mid-september american airborne  
forces seized bridges at nimigan and eindhoven 
attacks that went smoothly and with success  
the british first airborne division descended upon 
arnhem deep in the netherlands the british forces  
though were dropped not near enough to their 
targets they landed upon two ss panzer divisions  
that were re-equipping and the british plans for 
the operation were captured british forces found  
themselves pinned down and under increasing 
pressure failed to capture the bridge the  
action by ground forces to link up and relieve the 
paratroopers and glider troops was met by heavy  
german resistance and ground to a halt after a 
week the british were forced to admit defeat what  
troops could be saved were but six thousand were 
taken prisoner and more than one thousand killed
arnhem was not a decisive defeat in itself 
but the operation took allied attention away  
from the situation at antwerp the failure to 
mount a simple mopping up operation and make  
antwerp port operational was to lengthen the 
war after the chaos at arnhem the allies had  
to fight a series of difficult actions against 
the german forces that had taken the opportunity   to reinforce and prepare the battles were fought 
across the flooded and waterlogged low countries  
attacks had to be made by 
commandos with amphibious vehicles   canadian armies had to make repeated charges 
across open ground against prepared german  
artillery surrounded by dense infantry defenses 
pill boxes and strong points had to be taken one  
by one in close infantry action the towns of the 
region had to be cleared in fierce street fighting  
in the midst of all this engineers and naval 
minesweepers had to clear the mines and booby  
traps with which the germans had filled the 
waterways it was not until late november more  
than 80 days after its capture that antwerp 
was brought into action a desire for victory  
of an end to the fighting only condemned 
europe to enter another year of war [Music]  
next time on world war ii the complete history   in a desperate attempt to save germany 
hitler attempts to repeat the triumph of 1940  
with attacks through belgium in what history 
comes to call the battle of the bulge
the germans collapse in the east 
and russian armies enter germany   they encounter auschwitz and the full 
evil of nazism becomes known to the world  
the last act of a dying franklin roosevelt is to 
attend a conference of the great powers at yalta  
the leaders sit together not only to plan the 
war but to draw the map of post-war europe
[Music]
[Music]
the war in europe is entering its last desperate 
months the soldiers and civilians of continental  
europe can see the end in sight strategists 
search for solutions that can end the fighting  
and end the dying desperate strategies and tactics 
are deployed by germany and japan in the fantastic  
hope that somehow the war could be turned around 
and in some way victory even a compromise piece  
could be snatched from the hands of the allied 
enemy whose war aim is the total defeat of the  
axis the long-awaited invasion of france has 
taken place with operation overlord in june 1944  
armies have fought bitter battles french cities 
often destroyed to be liberated after a struggle  
of weeks where the germans had pinned the allies 
into normandy the american british canadian and  
free french forces broke out and caused the nazi 
forces to flee almost to the borders of germany  
in the optimism these victories created 
there was an impetus to end the war quickly  
before christmas the ambition led allied 
generals to abandon the patient preparations  
that it characterized overlord and 
made a bold thrust to cross the rhine  
and invade germany this resulted in the 
arnhem airborne attack the bridge too far  
it resulted in defeat for the allies the 
result was the war's prolongation [Music]
in the east the russian army has rolled 
back the germans to the edge of germany  
the red army is now a tool 
not of the defense of russia   its goal not the defeat of nazism but the 
instrument of stalin's post-war ambitions  
in the pacific island after island had been 
subject to invasion and conquest as the grip  
of american forces grows ever tighter and japan 
despite fanatical resistance faces utter defeat
in italy the fighting continued 
following the capture of rome   the germans had established another defensive 
line across the italian peninsula which once again  
had to be broken by frontal assault the german 
line of defenses was known as the gothic line  
and stretched across the central apennine 
mountains as they turned across the width of italy  
an ancient roman road running to the rear of 
the fortifications enabled the germans to move  
reserves and resources from point to point to 
deal with any allied attack the germans actually  
outnumbered the allies in this theater of war 
the balance only evened by allied superiority  
in air power and supplies [Music] the fighting 
in france had assumed prime place in allied plans  
and troops were withdrawn from italy to land in 
southern france and attacked germany directly
the american command had always regarded 
the italian campaign as a distracting  
sideshow that diverted the alliance from the 
main task of defeating nazism in its home  
the americans viewed with suspicion grand 
british plans to sweep up the leg of italy  
and then on to vienna coming at the right via the 
back door the u.s saw imperial britain at work  
looking to the post-war world and aiming to 
become the predominant mediterranean power [Music]  
the british were to be frustrated in this ambition 
and were forced to concede that there could be no  
grand attack in italy rather a series of assaults 
that would pin down german forces weakening the  
overall nazi strategic position the italian 
countryside was easily defended the central  
mountainous spine prevented maneuver 
shrinking the fighting onto narrow fronts
as the allies pushed further north they 
encountered large rivers such as the po  
flowing west to east which were to form yet 
another set of formidable natural barriers  
the autumn and winter were 
wet and turned the earth   into a glutinous morass making even 
the tiniest movement a supreme effort
this was a war fought in the landscape of the 
renaissance painting and it was a terrain where  
the renaissance army of men on foot and 
horse was more at home than a mechanized  
mid-20th century force steep mountains and hills 
were surmounted by still usefully fortified  
towns countless narrow valleys were cut by 
stream and river every few kilometers a bridge  
demolished by retreating germans would have 
to be rebuilt under the gun sites of the enemy
the italian fighting of that winter has been 
described as an engineer's war it was they  
who rebuilt the bridges disarmed the bombs 
and booby traps it was they who bulldozed  
ways through narrow streets of towns and villages 
which had been systematically demolished [Music]  
in the winter the war became bogged down 
and both sides drew back to await the  
dry weather for veterans of the eighth army 
who were fighting perhaps their fourth year  
of war old soldiers who knew a sideshow when 
they saw it the stalemate was relief [Music]  
in 1939 as the war began optimism was 
everywhere the british people and army  
sang a popular song which predicted that they 
would hang out the washing on the siegfried
[Music] line
the siegfried line named after a hero of 
wagnerian germanic legend was a line of  
powerful fortifications along germany's western 
border which ran for more than 450 kilometers  
and stood opposite the french maginot line while 
standing in opposition to the french defenses  
the german line was more likely built a series 
of infantry pill boxes and anti-tank barriers  
it was not designed to be 
impregnable rather to slow   any attacker whilst a mobile reserve was 
brought to bear against the would-be invader  
light as the secret line was when built in the 
1930s it still consumed a third of germany's  
annual production of building materials and 
the labor of more than half a million men
although lightweight the siegfried line 
did deter the french during the phony war  
and in 1940 the british army never hung 
anything on the secret line leaving  
most of its clothes behind dunkirk 
during the long years of occupation  
and nazi dominance the line was the border with 
a placid occupied territory and was neglected
as the western allies drew near the siegfried 
line became known as the west wall and became a  
battleground as the autumn of 1944 had turned 
to winter the advance of the allies slowed  
their failure to secure antwerp and used 
the port created a crisis of supply simply  
not enough fuel ammunition and food were reaching 
the allied armies hitler became convinced that the  
western allies had overreached and exposed 
themselves to a devastating counter-attack  
on december 16th that attack began [Music]  
the german forces had made a great effort to 
trawl through the population and find as many  
fresh troops as possible by december 1944 
another 150 000 soldiers had been scraped  
together and had been added to the german army 
german industry had made a tremendous last effort  
and had produced the material the tanks the fuel 
and the ammunition for a last great offensive  
hitler ambitiously planned to repeat his 
triumph of 1940 panzer armies would thrust  
through the forests of the ardennes then swing 
around to the rear of the british and americans  
then take antwerp and the balance of power 
in the west would swing back to the nazis the  
attack would be made in the deep winter when 
weather would ground the allied air forces  
v2 weapons would complete the victory with a 
devastation of london an officer who was given  
command of one of the panzer armies said all 
hitler wants me to do is cross a river capture  
brussels take antwerp through the ardennes when 
the snow is waste deep when it doesn't get light  
till eight and it's dark at four with divisions 
of kids and old men oh and at christmas too
the attack fell on weaker us units and showed 
as a great indentation in the line separating  
the two armies the offensive became known as the 
battle of the bulge the germans swept into belgium  
capturing many thousands of prisoners yet they 
underestimated the americans who reorganized and  
reinforced slowing the german attack on december 
22nd the weather lifted and allied air power began  
to slowly destroy the bulge all through january 
the us army slowly closed around the germans
the bulge offensive squandered 
the very last strength available   to the nazis winter closed around the 
armies and prevented any more fighting
hitler's decision to attack in the ardennes 
to spend his last strength in the west  
rather than turn against the red army in the east 
seems with the certain clarity of hindsight to be  
one of the german dictators greatest mistakes 
in the west the germans enjoyed many advantages  
natural defenses the great rivers of western 
europe and the extensive line of fortifications  
such as the west wall the siegfried line 
there was to be no such advantage in the east  
the strategic reality was that attacking in the 
west gave hitler a slim chance of victory whereas  
attack in the east would only serve 
to postpone the inevitable defeat
the failure of offensive in the ardennes 
made the final task of the red army easier  
yet as the communist army prepared for that final 
offensive the soviet high command was presented  
with difficult strategic choices the soviets 
had begun the war out of desperate self-defense  
against the 1941 german invasion they had not 
embarked upon a war of conquest now though  
events had conspired to present a tantalizing 
prize of expansion to the communists  
the decision was not how to defeat germany 
but how to make best use of the peace
the russians enjoyed a simple and large 
numerical advantage that enabled them   always to have a strategic reserve always to have 
something held back with which to hit the nazis
[Music] an exception to the domination of eastern 
europe by the soviet union is in yugoslavia  
a country where communist 
partisans under josef tito   are about to liberate their 
country from the german occupiers  
without the help of any foreign army this will 
make yugoslavia unique in the post-war world
in the winter of 1944 two very similar military 
forces faced very different fates the british  
home guard was disbanded in december 1944 
formed in the spring of 1940 as a nazi invasion  
seemed imminent the force performed a multitude 
of the simplest military tasks and if nothing  
else it allowed the regular army to concentrate on 
training and equipping new recruits the home guard  
kept vigil on airfields and factories it manned 
roadblocks and captured downed luftwaffe pilots  
originally composed mostly of men too old 
and those few too young for military service  
the reality of the home guard was 
different to any television comedy   as britain's position became more secure and 
the threat of invasion became more remote  
the home guard was integrated into the regular 
army and attached to regular units membership  
once voluntary became compulsory and the home 
guard became a preschool for military service  
devoted to preparing young men of 17 
and 18 for their eventual conscription
there came to be as many as three-quarters of 
a million home guards far from being a dad's  
army the average home guardsman was under 
30 years of age the home guard was for many  
a pleasant wartime hobby some members 
actually resenting any compulsory service  
such as when home guards were ordered to man 
anti-aircraft artillery [Music] as the home guard  
marched before their king through the streets of 
london the british amateur soldiers ended their  
service never having faced the ultimate test by 
having to meet their country's enemy in battle
the german folkster mobilized as the british 
disbanded all german men between 16 and 60 were  
drafted into service for the german home guard 
the experience was not one of increasing routine  
and organization rather it was of descent 
into an arctic chaos against the invaders  
with supplies becoming more scarce it was a force 
not organized by the traditional german army  
but by the nazi party towards the end of 
the war the ss was rounding up civilians  
and driving them at gunpoint to fight the 
invaders it was no hobby as the elderly and  
children went out with hand-held rocket 
launchers to face elite allied soldiers
if any in the allied nations doubted what all the 
fighting was for whether all the deaths were in  
vain in the last months of fighting in europe 
as allied soldiers entered the territory of  
the third reich conclusive and devastating proof 
of the evil of nazism was found as the death and  
concentration camps were uncovered nazism in its 
genesis had been anti-semitic to its very core  
jews were blamed for all of germany's 
misfortunes blamed for the first world war blamed  
for any ill that befell germanic peoples it was 
always dangerous to be jewish in the nazi state  
but the violence had been arbitrary the product 
of street gangs and unsympathetic law enforcement  
but with the conquest of poland a policy of 
gathering the jewish population into ghettos  
and then effectively starving the jewish 
population in those ghettos was implemented  
following the invasion of russia special ss death 
squads were ordered to follow behind the armies  
and ethnically cleanse the countryside of jews by 
mass shootings history cannot hide the fact that  
ukrainians ethnic romanians in southern russia 
and lithuanians were only too happy to assist the  
nazis in their evil work the work of these death 
squads horrified many ordinary german soldiers  
who witnessed the killings as bystanders 
the final solution was then introduced  
the systematic industrialized murder of all jews 
was carried out in secret and in remote places  
victims would be deported to camps far 
from home under the guise of resettlement
the final solution was not a monolithic 
single historical event some camps  
treblinka chilemo and sabibor where death 
camps for the purpose of mass murder alone
at the camp with the greatest notoriety auschwitz 
birkenau extermination was combined with slave  
labor the children the sick and the aged were 
killed on arrival by gassing the able-bodied were  
tattooed and assigned to be worked to death the 
soviet forces in the east encountered the horrors  
of the death camps largely after they had been 
abandoned in the face of the red army's advance  
many of the horrific images that have come 
down to us are the comparatively less brutal   slave labor camps such as belson and dachau 
established before the final solution was devised  
these places were found by the western 
armies the inhabitants of these camps  
were often deportees from the eastern camps
the images of such infernal brutality speak 
for themselves six million jews were to die
[Music] um
i've been here eight days and never in my 
life have i seen such damnable ghastliness  
this morning we buried over five thousand bodies 
we don't know who they are behind me you can see  
a pit which will contain another five thousand 
there are two others like it in preparation we  
actually know now what has been going on in these 
camps um i know personally what i am fighting
[Music]
for
[Music] the war had begun with germany's air 
force the most feared and effective in  
the world the last year of fighting was to 
see the utter prostration of the luftwaffe  
as the bombers of the raf and us army air 
force pounded the cities of germany to rubble  
long-range fighters systematically shot down the 
luftwaffe fighter force by 1945 the allied air  
forces had come to enjoy what is now called air 
supremacy allied planes were free from the threat  
of german fighters and were able to attack 
any target at any time anywhere in germany
the result was an oil famine as every oil 
refinery and synthetic oil factory were destroyed  
the remaining tanks and vehicles ground to a halt
the german transport system was utterly 
destroyed hardly a train or individual  
truck was able to move the shortest distance 
without inviting destruction from the air
above all the consequence of air supremacy was 
the terrible methodical demolition of germany  
cities killing thousands and creating a 
multitude of homeless in february 1945  
one of the most controversial raids of the 
strategic bombing campaign was made on dresden  
800 british lancasters and 300 american flying 
fortresses attacked the east german city until  
then untouched by the war dresden was 
not a center of industry it was a city  
famed for architectural beauty dresden was 
crammed with civilians fleeing the russians  
50 000 were killed in one night as the 
bombers raised a firestorm in the city  
produced a shockwave of doubt among the allies 
even churchill doubted the rightness of the raid
the debate on the morality and 
effectiveness of the air war   will last forever the fact remains though that 
the war in europe was shortened by the attacks
the war brought forward many new technologies 
the air war was no different in january 1945  
just as the allies had all but driven 
the german fighters from the skies   the luftwaffe deployed a new aircraft the 
first operational jet fighter the me-262  
the tremendous speed of the new plane 
made the 262 invulnerable yet it was  
a weapon that arrived too late and 
in too few numbers to save the reich
[Music] as allied armies were fighting on the 
borders of germany the united states  
army air force unleashed a campaign of heavy 
unrestricted area bombing on the cities of japan  
bases built on captured islands were used 
to launch mass attacks by giant b-29 bombers  
that aimed to pulverize the japanese islands the 
decision was taken to attack the wooden cities  
with incendiary bombs echoing the methods of the 
raf in germany and abandoning the usual american  
tactic of precision attacks on industrial and 
military targets on february 25th 150 b-29s made  
a huge attack on the japanese capital and burned 
away two and a half square kilometers of tokyo  
the us air force then altered the role of the 
b-29 to make the attacks even more devastating  
the heavily armed b-29 was designed to fly at 
high altitude it was now to fly at low level  
and at night and was stripped of its defensive 
gunners less fuel was needed and so the plane  
could carry even more bombs in early march 300 
b-29s attacked tokyo and raised a firestorm the  
giant fire destroyed a quarter of the city and 
killed 85 000 civilians in the coming month every  
major japanese city was attacked and destroyed 
by planes using these tactics a month later  
and the b-29s began to systematically 
destroy the lesser industrial cities
[Music]   in the southern pacific the long fight for 
the liberation of the philippine islands from  
japanese domination continued us general macarthur 
a man for whom the islands had been a second home  
had vowed to return to liberate the territory   although a landing had been made in october 
1944 us forces were embroiled in a long fight  
through the large islands and the scattered 
archipelagos of islands the japanese forced  
their enemy to fight for every meter of territory 
on the road to the philippines capital manila
it was another battle where a town had 
to be virtually destroyed to be freed   from occupation in february 16 000 japanese 
and nearly 100 000 filipino civilians died  
the philippines had been part of the grand 
japanese scheme to liberate asia from european  
domination many filipinos were proud of their 
westernized attitude the islands harbored the only  
serious organized resistance movement against the 
japanese partisans who aided the american forces  
in fighting their occupiers as the japanese 
were pushed to the remote areas of the islands  
macarthur was to show a style of leadership that 
was to characterize his role in the post-war world  
he embraced and forgave those filipinos 
who had collaborated with the japanese  
seeing a stability based on forgive and forget 
as the best future for the liberated territory
in february 1945 perhaps the most famous 
land battle of the pacific war was fought  
as yet another amphibious attack was mounted by 
the us navy they attacked the island of iwo jima  
iwo jima was one more stepping stone on the 
path towards invasion of japan a base from  
which attacks could bring the war home to the 
people of japan the island was part of a volcanic  
archipelago its name translates to sulfur island 
the volcanic geology made trenches and dugouts in  
which soldiers took cover too hot to endure it was 
earth from which issued poisonous volcanic gases  
it was a landscape of razor-edged ridges deep 
ravines and natural caves a natural fortress  
unto which the japanese defenders had piled layer 
upon layer of concrete and steel fortification  
the conflict followed the same grim script 
which had directed the fighting on other islands  
with each island as the fighting grew ever nearer 
to japan the determination of the defenders  
reached new levels of passion more than 110 000 
u.s marines were resisted by just 22 000 japanese  
the japanese did not oppose the landing they 
allowed the massive naval bombardment to fall on  
empty defenses they allowed the american forces 
to land and then engage the invaders at close  
quarter with hand-to-hand fighting where weight 
of bombardment and air power were neutralized  
and individual fighting spirit would give the 
advantage the battle was fought meter by meter  
the japanese made a last stand in a narrow rocky 
gorge little more than half a kilometer in length  
it took us forces 10 days of constant combat 
to defeat the defenders who had to be killed  
man by man a third of the marines became 
casualties and the battle passed into legend  
the image of marines raising the stars and stripes 
on iwo jima became an american icon of victory  
in february 1945 the leaders of 
the allies had come together to   discuss the strategy of the war 
at yalta in the russian crimea
yalta was a decisive movement in the timeline of 
the war in that it was a meeting not about the  
conduct of the war but more about the post-war 
peace already churchill and stalin had made an  
agreement to effectively partition eastern europe 
they had assigned crude percentages of influence  
britain was to have ninety percent of the 
influence in greece bulgaria and romania  
were to be ninety percent soviet yalta agreed the 
shape of the future united nations organization  
yalta agreed to divide germany into zones 
of occupation [Music] the conference also  
decided the post-war fate of poland poland's 
freedom was the original cause of the war  
poland had been britain's ally at a time when 
the soviet union of nazi germany had made pacts  
of friendship as the leaders met polish troops 
were dying and fighting alongside the armies of  
america and britain yet at yalta in return for a 
promise by stalin to enter the war against japan  
the soviet union was to be given 
eastern poland the polish government  
that had fled in 1939 was to be abandoned 
in favor of a communist puppet government  
at yalta the alliance was already dissolving 
into self-interest roosevelt made a secret deal  
with stalin hidden from churchill to reward 
the ussr even more with territory in asia  
yalta was to condemn many thousands to die 
stalin demanded the return of any soviet  
citizens in the west prisoners of war soviet 
anti-communists who had gone over to the nazis  
the fate of these people even 
genuine prisoners of war who   had fought bravely for the soviet union 
was mostly death or the gulag [Music]  
amongst the leaders who sat in conference at 
yalta franklin roosevelt was unique in that  
he was the only one of the three that subjected 
his war leadership to the judgment of his country  
churchill sat atop a wartime coalition that had 
effectively suspended british democracy for the  
duration stalin was of course a dictator 
whose power depended on fear and violence  
the russian was in many ways an 
even greater dictator than hitler   who had come to power through democracy and 
enjoyed genuine popular german support [Music]  
the machinery of the us constitution however would 
not stop for war and in november 1944 roosevelt  
stood for election for a record fourth term 
roosevelt won yet his victory was not a landslide  
he led his republican opponent thomas dewey 413 
to 118 votes in the u.s electoral college in the  
popular vote roosevelt won 23 million votes to 
dewey's 20 million it was a demonstration of why  
america was fighting the war a proof of democracy 
strength when pitted against dictatorship  
roosevelt attended yalta a secretly sick and dying 
man his death on april 10 1945 at the age of 63  
came as a stunning surprise to the world many 
u s servicemen refused to believe the news
on that day vice president harry s truman was 
sworn in as 33rd president truman was little known  
and thought to lack experience within minutes of 
his swearing in u.s secretary of war henry stimson  
drew truman aside and revealed to him the greatest 
secret of the war a new explosive the atomic bomb
[Music] the allies had first reached german territory in 
the west as early as october 1944 they had seized  
after fierce defense the german town of aachen 
on the dutch border in fact the real border of  
germany that which posed the true obstacle was 
the river rhine this was to be the last major  
barrier to the allies their first objective was 
to clear the approaches to the rivers west bank  
and then sees a river crossing most troops 
found the river crossings demolished by the  
germans but at raymargan u s troops captured 
a bridge by accident in the south u.s general  
george patton surprised german defenders with an 
improvised attack and seized the bridge at mains
[Music]   in the north bernard montgomery made elaborately 
planned attacks that captured more bridgeheads in  
the space of three weeks the western allies 
had seized the eastern bank of the rhine   and stood ready for the final act of the 
west european war one of the first moves  
was to surround the ruler the industrial region 
of germany stalin was convinced that a secret deal  
existed between the western allies in germany that 
germany would make no resistance to the allied  
attacks in the west in order to strengthen the 
position of america and britain in post-war europe
the orders under which soldiers fought and died   were now the product of political rival rings 
for power in post-war europe churchill wanted  
the allies to race to berlin to reach the 
german capital before the russians instead  
the americans had their way and the decision 
was taken to allow the russians to take berlin
as the war in germany neared its end german 
forces in italy were still providing the  
allies with stiff opposition in early april 
the allied armies which had been brought to a  
standstill by the germans in the winter opened a 
massive offensive upon the german defensive lines  
the allies mounted devastating air raids and 
heavy artillery bombardments time and time again  
german defenders expected a subsequent infantry 
attack only to be hit again by heavy bombardment  
eventually when that infantry attack 
came it enjoyed the special training  
and special equipment that bridged 
the obstacles of the italian terrain
the resistance of the germans finally broke and 
they were trapped with their backs to the river  
heavy equipment and vehicles were   lost and retreating germans were 
forced to flee to safety [Music]  
bologna fell to the allies on april 21st   partisans had risen up in revolt and had 
taken over the cities of milan and turin  
the italian people who had begun the war as 
enemies welcomed the allied soldiers as liberators
on april 28th as hitler sat in his berlin 
bunker contemplating the death of both  
himself and of nazism the end came for 
the italian fascist dictator mussolini  
mussolini had planned to escape to 
the italian alps and lead a last stand  
driving in disguise through partisan hell 
territory he was captured and shot his body  
with that of his mistress was hung 
from a lamppost in a street in milan
iwo jima was a dread warning of what might 
lie in store for the us armies who were to  
take part in the last great battle of the 
pacific war at okinawa in the numbers and  
scale of operation only the overlord landings in 
normandy exceeded the pacific invasion of okinawa  
a little more than 500 kilometers from mainland 
japan okinawa would be the penultimate step  
the us committed more than half a million 
troops and one thousand two hundred warships  
the u.s fleet was joined by the british pacific 
fleet massive preliminary bombardments by ships  
and planes preceded the landings on april 1st 
as at iwo jima the commander of the japanese  
withdrew his forces inland concentrating 
them into fortified defensive positions  
his aim was not to repel the invasion but 
to simply kill as many invaders as possible
six days after the landings the japanese navy 
mounted massive kamikaze attacks more than 1  
900 kamikaze missions were flown and caused 
allied losses which were without precedent  
the largest total of kamikaze attacks was matched 
by what was perhaps the largest individual suicide  
mission the yamato the largest battleship in the 
world was dispatched on a kamikaze mission of its  
own it was to smash its way through the allied 
fleets and beach itself on okinawa thus becoming  
an unsinkable giant battery the battleship 
was however sunk on route to its mission  
the fighting lasted from april to june 22nd of 77 
000 japanese defenders less than one tenth were  
captured to become prisoners 36 us warships 
were sung mostly through kamikaze attacks  
nearly 5 000 u.s sailors nearly 8 000 
marines and soldiers were killed nearly 32  
000 wounded and over 750 u.s aircraft shot down 
okinawa made it clear to the united states that  
the japanese would exact a horrific price of any 
invader of the japanese home islands it was this  
price that lay heavily upon the shoulders 
of those who were to command the us forces
[Music]   it is perhaps a measure of the utter and 
total nature of the defeat inflicted upon  
germany that there was to be no 
resistance to the occupying allied armies
as the territory of the reich was fought 
over and destroyed hitler had ordered the  
construction of what he called the national 
redoubt this was to be a fortified region  
based in the mountains of southern bavaria the 
home of nazism the national redoubt was to be  
manned and defended by the werewolves fanatical 
nazi terrorists who would act as an underground  
resistance hitler's deputy martin borman said 
the werewolf has been born of national socialism  
it makes no allowances and knows no consideration 
as imposed on regular troops hatred shall be our  
prayer revenge our battle cry the werewolves of 
1945 became as unreal as any fairy tale monster
[Music]   in world war ii cities were to prove powerful 
fortifications better perhaps than the complex  
specially built structures such as the 
maginot line the maze of streets lined with  
solidly constructed public buildings themselves 
labyrinths of corridors and passages were ready  
made for defenders the sewers the tunnels and 
the sellers became ready-made bunkers the more  
demolished by artillery and air bombardment 
the more easily defended the cities became
as russian armies pressed ever closer to berlin   hitler retreated to his 
bunker deep beneath the city
all through the spring of 1945 the russians 
amassed troops for the final battle on april 10th  
this massive force was unleashed in spite of the 
desperate position of the third reich there was  
no lack of germans prepared to fight to the very 
last in the defense of berlin by april 26 460 000  
russians with 1500 tanks 13 000 guns and 26 000 
rocket launchers surrounded the inner city center  
the city's civilians cowered in the cellars 
under shellfire without food or water behind  
the advancing russians of the front line came a 
second wave of soviet troops some of them freed  
prisoners of war bent on revenge with the 
mass murder rape and looting of civilians  
many of those nazis who fought in this last battle   where by the chance of war belgian dutch or 
french who had volunteered to fight communism
with the russians meters away 
hitler committed suicide [Music]  
an hour before hitler's death soviet 
soldiers had taken the reich's chancellery  
hitler had appointed admiral carl dernitz as 
his successor as leader of the german people  
some of those who remained 
in power after hitler's death   believed in a fantasy that a truce preparatory 
to peace talks could still be arranged  
the only answer the russians gave was a demand for 
unconditional surrender and even heavier shelling
[Music]   on may 2nd the german forces defending berlin 
requested a ceasefire and at 3pm the russian guns  
fell silent the last great battle of the european 
war had been fought with a terrible toll of death  
in the three weeks of fighting for berlin the 
red army had lost 10 percent of its strength  
the heaviest losses of the war apart from the 
great collapses of the early years of barbarossa
the last days of the reich were dominated by 
attempts to avoid the wrath of the russians  
dernitz attempted to buy time for eastern 
armies to make fighting withdrawals  
the forces in the west were surrendered 
piecemeal on may 4th the netherlands  
denmark and northwestern germany 
surrendered to british general montgomery
on may 5th the germans offered to surrender 
to all american forces again hoping to buy  
time eisenhower told the germans unconditional 
surrender were the only terms on offer  
it was agreed all german forces 
would cease operations on may   8th the surrender was signed at reims 
in france at eisenhower's headquarters
stalin suspected treachery and demanded 
a separate surrender be signed in berlin  
may 8th was designated victory 
in europe day ve day [Music]
in europe vast tides of humanity waves of 
misery swept through ruined streets and cities  
desperately seeking for food shelter and safety 
amongst the wreckage of civilization [Music]  
in every city town and 
village of britain and america   ecstatic crowds filled the 
streets to celebrate the victory
[Music]   next time on world war ii the complete history 
the world awakens from the party of ve day  
to realize that a war remains to be fought the 
final act of the tragedy of the war is played out  
in the pacific ocean fate has catapulted 
harry s truman to the center of events  
the largely unknown u s politician projected into 
the presidency by the death of franklin roosevelt  
now finds that he must make a decision which 
will end the war at a stroke his grim choice  
is whether or not to deploy the atomic 
bomb against the cities of japan  
the forces of soviet communism continue fighting 
some days after ve day ensuring the map of europe  
is a reflection of stalin's paranoia and 
[Music] suspicions at the potsdam conference  
germany is divided and dismembered divisions 
that will last for nearly two generations at  
potsdam a new face represents britain as winston 
churchill loses the post-war election [Music]  
in the ruins of europe a swirling mass of 
humanity struggles to rebuild a continent  
and the united states marshall plan is 
devised to create a stable future [Music]  
india becomes free of the british empire [Music]  
in the french colony of vietnam 
a struggle begins for liberation
[Music]   the iron curtain falls as the 
soviet empire is created with  
all of eastern europe falling under 
the domination of the soviet union
